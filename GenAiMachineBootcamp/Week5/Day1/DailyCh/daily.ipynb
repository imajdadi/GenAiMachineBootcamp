two travellers might have been observed swiftlyat a pace of six miles in the hourdescending the rugged side of a mountain the younger bounding from crag to crag with the agility of a fawn while his companion whose aged limbs seemed ill at ease in the heavy chain armour habitually worn by tourists in that district toiled on painfully at his side As is always the case under such circumstances the younger knight was the first to break the silence A goodly pace I trow he exclaimed We sped not thus in the ascent Goodly indeed the other echoed with a groan We clomb it but at three miles in the hour And on the dead level our pace is the younger suggested for he was weak in statistics and left all such details to his aged companion Four miles in the hour the other wearily replied Not an ounce more he added with that love of metaphor so common in old age and not a farthing less Twas three hours past high noon when we left our hostelry the young man said musingly We shall scarce be back by suppertime Perchance mine host will roundly deny us all food He will chide our tardy return was the grave reply and such a rebuke will be meet A brave conceit cried the other with a merry laugh And should we bid him bring us yet another course I trow his answer will be tart We shall but get our deserts sighed the elder knight who had never seen a joke in his life and was somewhat displeased at his companions untimely levity Twill be nine of the clock he added in an undertone by the time we regain our hostelry Full many a mile shall we have plodded this day How many How many cried the eager youth ever athirst for knowledge The old man was silent Tell me he answered after a moments thought what time it was when we stood together on yonder peak Not exact to the minute he added hastily reading a protest in the young mans face An thy guess be within one poor halfhour of the mark tis all I ask of thy mothers son Then will I tell thee true to the last inch how far we shall have trudged betwixt three and nine of the clock A groan was the young mans only reply while his convulsed features and the deep wrinkles that chased each other across his manly brow revealed the abyss of arithmetical agony into which one chance question had plunged him KNOT II ELIGIBLE APARTMENTS Straight down the crooked lane And all round the square Lets ask Balbus about it said Hugh All right said Lambert _He_ can guess it said Hugh Rather said Lambert No more words were needed the two brothers understood each other perfectly Illustration BALBUS WAS ASSISTING HIS MOTHERINLAW TO CONVINCE THE DRAGON Balbus was waiting for them at the hotel the journey down had tired him he said so his two pupils had been the round of the place in search of lodgings without the old tutor who had been their inseparable companion from their childhood They had named him after the hero of their Latin exercisebook which overflowed with anecdotes of that versatile geniusanecdotes whose vagueness in detail was more than compensated by their sensational brilliance Balbus has overcome all his enemies had been marked by their tutor in the margin of the book Successful Bravery In this way he had tried to extract a moral from every anecdote about Balbussometimes one of warning as in Balbus had borrowed a healthy dragon against which he had written Rashness in Speculationsometimes of encouragement as in the words Influence of Sympathy in United Action which stood opposite to the anecdote Balbus was assisting his motherinlaw to convince the dragonand sometimes it dwindled down to a single word such as Prudence which was all he could extract from the touching record that Balbus having scorched the tail of the dragon went away His pupils liked the short morals best as it left them more room for marginal illustrations and in this instance they required all the space they could get to exhibit the rapidity of the heros departure Their report of the state of things was discouraging That most fashionable of wateringplaces Little Mendip was chockfull as the boys expressed it from end to end But in one Square they had seen no less than four cards in different houses all announcing in flaming capitals ELIGIBLE APARTMENTS So theres plenty of choice after all you see said spokesman Hugh in conclusion That doesnt follow from the data said Balbus as he rose from the easy chair where he had been dozing over _The Little Mendip Gazette_ They may be all single rooms However we may as well see them I shall be glad to stretch my legs a bit An unprejudiced bystander might have objected that the operation was needless and that this long lank creature would have been all the better with even shorter legs but no such thought occurred to his loving pupils One on each side they did their best to keep up with his gigantic strides while Hugh repeated the sentence in their fathers letter just received from abroad over which he and Lambert had been puzzling He says a friend of his the Governor of_what_ was that name again Lambert Kgovjni said Lambert Well yes The Governor ofwhatyoumaycallitwants to give a _very_ small dinnerparty and he means to ask his fathers brotherinlaw his brothers fatherinlaw his fatherinlaws brother and his brotherinlaws father and were to guess how many guests there will be There was an anxious pause _How_ large did he say the pudding was to be Balbus said at last Take its cubical contents divide by the cubical contents of what each man can eat and the quotient He didnt say anything about pudding said Hugh and heres the Square as they turned a corner and came into sight of the eligible apartments It _is_ a Square was Balbus first cry of delight as he gazed around him Beautiful Beautiful Equilateral _And_ rectangular The boys looked round with less enthusiasm Number nine is the first with a card said prosaic Lambert but Balbus would not so soon awake from his dream of beauty See boys he cried Twenty doors on a side What symmetry Each side divided into twentyone equal parts Its delicious Shall I knock or ring said Hugh looking in some perplexity at a square brass plate which bore the simple inscription RING ALSO Both said Balbus Thats an Ellipsis my boy Did you never see an Ellipsis before I couldnt hardly read it said Hugh evasively Its no good having an Ellipsis if they dont keep it clean Which there is _one_ room gentlemen said the smiling landlady And a sweet room too As snug a little backroom We will see it said Balbus gloomily as they followed her in I knew how it would be One room in each house No view I suppose Which indeed there _is_ gentlemen the landlady indignantly protested as she drew up the blind and indicated the back garden Cabbages I perceive said Balbus Well theyre green at any rate Which the greens at the shops their hostess explained are by no means dependable upon Here you has them on the premises _and_ of the best Does the window open was always Balbus first question in testing a lodging and Does the chimney smoke his second Satisfied on all points he secured the refusal of the room and they moved on to Number Twentyfive This landlady was grave and stern Ive nobbut one room left she told them and it gives on the backgyardin But there are cabbages Balbus suggested The landlady visibly relented There is sir she said and good ones though I say it as shouldnt We cant rely on the shops for greens So we grows them ourselves A singular advantage said Balbus and after the usual questions they went on to Fiftytwo And Id gladly accommodate you all if I could was the greeting that met them We are but mortal Irrelevant muttered Balbus and Ive let all my rooms but one Which one is a backroom I perceive said Balbus and looking out onon cabbages I presume Yes indeed sir said their hostess Whatever _other_ folks may do _we_ grows our own For the shops An excellent arrangement Balbus interrupted Then one can really depend on their being good Does the window open The usual questions were answered satisfactorily but this time Hugh added one of his own inventionDoes the cat scratch The landlady looked round suspiciously as if to make sure the cat was not listening I will not deceive you gentlemen she said It _do_ scratch but not without you pulls its whiskers Itll never do it she repeated slowly with a visible effort to recall the exact words of some written agreement between herself and the cat without you pulls its whiskers Much may be excused in a cat so treated said Balbus as they left the house and crossed to Number Seventythree leaving the landlady curtseying on the doorstep and still murmuring to herself her parting words as if they were a form of blessing not without you pulls its whiskers At Number Seventythree they found only a small shy girl to show the house who said yesm in answer to all questions The usual room said Balbus as they marched in the usual backgarden the usual cabbages I suppose you cant get them good at the shops Yesm said the girl Well you may tell your mistress we will take the room and that her plan of growing her own cabbages is simply _admirable_ Yesm said the girl as she showed them out One dayroom and three bedrooms said Balbus as they returned to the hotel We will take as our dayroom the one that gives us the least walking to do to get to it Must we walk from door to door and count the steps said Lambert No no Figure it out my boys figure it out Balbus gaily exclaimed as he put pens ink and paper before his hapless pupils and left the room I say Itll be a job said Hugh Rather said Lambert KNOT III MAD MATHESIS I waited for the train Well they call me so because I _am_ a little mad I suppose she said goodhumouredly in answer to Claras cautiouslyworded question as to how she came by so strange a nickname You see I never do what sane people are expected to do nowadays I never wear long trains talking of trains thats the Charing Cross Metropolitan StationIve something to tell you about _that_ and I never play lawntennis I cant cook an omelette I cant even set a broken limb _Theres_ an ignoramus for you Clara was her niece and full twenty years her junior in fact she was still attending a High Schoolan institution of which Mad Mathesis spoke with undisguised aversion Let a woman be meek and lowly she would say None of your High Schools for me But it was vacationtime just now and Clara was her guest and Mad Mathesis was showing her the sights of that Eighth Wonder of the worldLondon The Charing Cross Metropolitan Station she resumed waving her hand towards the entrance as if she were introducing her niece to a friend The Bayswater and Birmingham Extension is just completed and the trains now run round and round continuouslyskirting the border of Wales just touching at York and so round by the east coast back to London The way the trains run is _most_ peculiar The westerly ones go round in two hours the easterly ones take three but they always manage to start two trains from here opposite ways punctually every quarterofanhour They part to meet again said Clara her eyes filling with tears at the romantic thought No need to cry about it her aunt grimly remarked They dont meet on the same line of rails you know Talking of meeting an idea strikes me she added changing the subject with her usual abruptness Lets go opposite ways round and see which can meet most trains No need for a chaperonladies saloon you know You shall go whichever way you like and well have a bet about it I never make bets Clara said very gravely Our excellent preceptress has often warned us Youd be none the worse if you did Mad Mathesis interrupted In fact youd be the better Im certain Neither does our excellent preceptress approve of puns said Clara But well have a match if you like Let me choose my train she added after a brief mental calculation and Ill engage to meet exactly half as many again as you do Not if you count fair Mad Mathesis bluntly interrupted Remember we only count the trains we meet _on the way_ You mustnt count the one that starts as you start nor the one that arrives as you arrive That will only make the difference of _one_ train said Clara as they turned and entered the station But I never travelled alone before Therell be no one to help me to alight However I dont mind Lets have a match A ragged little boy overheard her remark and came running after her Buy a box of cigarlights Miss he pleaded pulling her shawl to attract her attention Clara stopped to explain I never smoke cigars she said in a meekly apologetic tone Our excellent preceptress but Mad Mathesis impatiently hurried her on and the little boy was left gazing after her with round eyes of amazement The two ladies bought their tickets and moved slowly down the central platform Mad Mathesis prattling on as usualClara silent anxiously reconsidering the calculation on which she rested her hopes of winning the match Mind where you go dear cried her aunt checking her just in time One step more and youd have been in that pail of cold water I know I know Clara said dreamily The pale the cold and the moony Take your places on the springboards shouted a porter What are _they_ for Clara asked in a terrified whisper Merely to help us into the trains The elder lady spoke with the nonchalance of one quite used to the process Very few people can get into a carriage without help in less than three seconds and the trains only stop for one second At this moment the whistle was heard and two trains rushed into the station A moments pause and they were gone again but in that brief interval several hundred passengers had been shot into them each flying straight to his place with the accuracy of a Minie bulletwhile an equal number were showered out upon the sideplatforms Three hours had passed away and the two friends met again on the Charing Cross platform and eagerly compared notes Then Clara turned away with a sigh To young impulsive hearts like hers disappointment is always a bitter pill Mad Mathesis followed her full of kindly sympathy Try again my love she said cheerily Let us vary the experiment We will start as we did before but not to begin counting till our trains meet When we see each other we will say One and so count on till we come here again Clara brightened up I shall win _that_ she exclaimed eagerly if I may choose my train Another shriek of engine whistles another upheaving of springboards another living avalanche plunging into two trains as they flashed by and the travellers were off again Each gazed eagerly from her carriage window holding up her handkerchief as a signal to her friend A rush and a roar Two trains shot past each other in a tunnel and two travellers leaned back in their corners with a sighor rather with _two_ sighsof relief One Clara murmured to herself Won Its a word of good omen _This_ time at any rate the victory will be mine But _was_ it KNOT IV THE DEAD RECKONING I did dream of moneybags tonight Noonday on the open sea within a few degrees of the Equator is apt to be oppressively warm and our two travellers were now airily clad in suits of dazzling white linen having laid aside the chainarmour which they had found not only endurable in the cold mountain air they had lately been breathing but a necessary precaution against the daggers of the banditti who infested the heights Their holidaytrip was over and they were now on their way home in the monthly packet which plied between the two great ports of the island they had been exploring Along with their armour the tourists had laid aside the antiquated speech it had pleased them to affect while in knightly disguise and had returned to the ordinary style of two country gentlemen of the Twentieth Century Stretched on a pile of cushions under the shade of a huge umbrella they were lazily watching some native fishermen who had come on board at the last landingplace each carrying over his shoulder a small but heavy sack A large weighingmachine that had been used for cargo at the last port stood on the deck and round this the fishermen had gathered and with much unintelligible jabber seemed to be weighing their sacks More like sparrows in a tree than human talk isnt it the elder tourist remarked to his son who smiled feebly but would not exert himself so far as to speak The old man tried another listener What have they got in those sacks Captain he inquired as that great being passed them in his never ending parade to and fro on the deck The Captain paused in his march and towered over the travellerstall grave and serenely selfsatisfied Fishermen he explained are often passengers in My ship These five are from Mhruxithe place we last touched atand thats the way they carry their money The money of this island is heavy gentlemen but it costs little as you may guess We buy it from them by weightabout five shillings a pound I fancy a ten poundnote would buy all those sacks By this time the old man had closed his eyesin order no doubt to concentrate his thoughts on these interesting facts but the Captain failed to realise his motive and with a grunt resumed his monotonous march Meanwhile the fishermen were getting so noisy over the weighingmachine that one of the sailors took the precaution of carrying off all the weights leaving them to amuse themselves with such substitutes in the form of winchhandles belayingpins c as they could find This brought their excitement to a speedy end they carefully hid their sacks in the folds of the jib that lay on the deck near the tourists and strolled away When next the Captains heavy footfall passed the younger man roused himself to speak _What_ did you call the place those fellows came from Captain he asked Mhruxi sir And the one we are bound for The Captain took a long breath plunged into the word and came out of it nobly They call it Kgovjni sir KI give it up the young man faintly said He stretched out his hand for a glass of iced water which the compassionate steward had brought him a minute ago and had set down unluckily just outside the shadow of the umbrella It was scalding hot and he decided not to drink it The effort of making this resolution coming close on the fatiguing conversation he had just gone through was too much for him he sank back among the cushions in silence His father courteously tried to make amends for his _nonchalance_ Whereabouts are we now Captain said he Have you any idea The Captain cast a pitying look on the ignorant landsman I could tell you _that_ sir he said in a tone of lofty condescension to an inch You dont say so the old man remarked in a tone of languid surprise And mean so persisted the Captain Why what do you suppose would become of My ship if I were to lose My Longitude and My Latitude Could _you_ make anything of My Dead Reckoning Nobody could Im sure the other heartily rejoined But he had overdone it Its _perfectly_ intelligible the Captain said in an offended tone to any one that understands such things With these words he moved away and began giving orders to the men who were preparing to hoist the jib Our tourists watched the operation with such interest that neither of them remembered the five moneybags which in another moment as the wind filled out the jib were whirled overboard and fell heavily into the sea But the poor fishermen had not so easily forgotten their property In a moment they had rushed to the spot and stood uttering cries of fury and pointing now to the sea and now to the sailors who had caused the disaster The old man explained it to the Captain Let us make it up among us he added in conclusion Ten pounds will do it I think you said Illustration But the Captain put aside the suggestion with a wave of the hand No sir he said in his grandest manner You will excuse Me I am sure but these are My passengers The accident has happened on board My ship and under My orders It is for Me to make compensation He turned to the angry fishermen Come here my men he said in the Mhruxian dialect Tell me the weight of each sack I saw you weighing them just now Then ensued a perfect Babel of noise as the five natives explained all screaming together how the sailors had carried off the weights and they had done what they could with whatever came handy Two iron belayingpins three blocks six holystones four winchhandles and a large hammer were now carefully weighed the Captain superintending and noting the results But the matter did not seem to be settled even then an angry discussion followed in which the sailors and the five natives all joined and at last the Captain approached our tourists with a disconcerted look which he tried to conceal under a laugh Its an absurd difficulty he said Perhaps one of you gentlemen can suggest something It seems they weighed the sacks two at a time If they didnt have five separate weighings of course you cant value them separately the youth hastily decided Lets hear all about it was the old mans more cautious remark They _did_ have five separate weighings the Captain said butWell it beats _me_ entirely he added in a sudden burst of candour Heres the result First and second sack weighed twelve pounds second and third thirteen and a half third and fourth eleven and a half fourth and fifth eight and then they say they had only the large hammer left and it took _three_ sacks to weigh it downthats the first third and fifthand _they_ weighed sixteen pounds There gentlemen Did you ever hear anything like _that_ The old man muttered under his breath If only my sister were here and looked helplessly at his son His son looked at the five natives The five natives looked at the Captain The Captain looked at nobody his eyes were cast down and he seemed to be saying softly to himself Contemplate one another gentlemen if such be your good pleasure _I_ contemplate _Myself_ KNOT V OUGHTS AND CROSSES Look here upon this picture and on this And what made you choose the first train Goosey said Mad Mathesis as they got into the cab Couldnt you count better than _that_ I took an extreme case was the tearful reply Our excellent preceptress always says When in doubt my dears take an extreme case And I _was_ in doubt Does it always succeed her aunt enquired Clara sighed Not _always_ she reluctantly admitted And I cant make out why One day she was telling the little girlsthey make such a noise at tea you knowThe more noise you make the less jam you will have and _vice versâ_ And I thought they wouldnt know what _vice versâ_ meant so I explained it to them I said If you make an infinite noise youll get no jam and if you make no noise youll get an infinite lot of jam But our excellent preceptress said that wasnt a good instance _Why_ wasnt it she added plaintively Her aunt evaded the question One sees certain objections to it she said But how did you work it with the Metropolitan trains None of them go infinitely fast I believe I called them hares and tortoises Clara saida little timidly for she dreaded being laughed at And I thought there couldnt be so many hares as tortoises on the Line so I took an extreme caseone hare and an infinite number of tortoises An extreme case indeed her aunt remarked with admirable gravity and a most dangerous state of things And I thought if I went with a tortoise there would be only _one_ hare to meet but if I went with the hareyou know there were _crowds_ of tortoises It wasnt a bad idea said the elder lady as they left the cab at the entrance of Burlington House You shall have another chance today Well have a match in marking pictures Clara brightened up I should like to try again very much she said Ill take more care this time How are we to play To this question Mad Mathesis made no reply she was busy drawing lines down the margins of the catalogue See she said after a minute Ive drawn three columns against the names of the pictures in the long room and I want you to fill them with oughts and crossescrosses for good marks and oughts for bad The first column is for choice of subject the second for arrangement the third for colouring And these are the conditions of the match You must give three crosses to two or three pictures You must give two crosses to four or five Do you mean _only_ two crosses said Clara Or may I count the threecross pictures among the twocross pictures Of course you may said her aunt Any one that has _three_ eyes may be said to have _two_ eyes I suppose Clara followed her aunts dreamy gaze across the crowded gallery halfdreading to find that there was a threeeyed person in sight And you must give one cross to nine or ten And which wins the match Clara asked as she carefully entered these conditions on a blank leaf in her catalogue Whichever marks fewest pictures But suppose we marked the same number Then whichever uses most marks Clara considered I dont think its much of a match she said I shall mark nine pictures and give three crosses to three of them two crosses to two more and one cross each to all the rest Will you indeed said her aunt Wait till youve heard all the conditions my impetuous child You must give three oughts to one or two pictures two oughts to three or four and one ought to eight or nine I dont want you to be _too_ hard on the RAs Clara quite gasped as she wrote down all these fresh conditions Its a great deal worse than Circulating Decimals she said But Im determined to win all the same Her aunt smiled grimly We can begin _here_ she said as they paused before a gigantic picture which the catalogue informed them was the Portrait of Lieutenant Brown mounted on his favorite elephant He looks awfully conceited said Clara I dont think he was the elephants favorite Lieutenant What a hideous picture it is And it takes up room enough for twenty Mind what you say my dear her aunt interposed Its by an RA But Clara was quite reckless I dont care who its by she cried And I shall give it three bad marks Aunt and niece soon drifted away from each other in the crowd and for the next halfhour Clara was hard at work putting in marks and rubbing them out again and hunting up and down for suitable pictures This she found the hardest part of all I _cant_ find the one I want she exclaimed at last almost crying with vexation What is it you want to find my dear The voice was strange to Clara but so sweet and gentle that she felt attracted to the owner of it even before she had seen her and when she turned and met the smiling looks of two little old ladies whose round dimpled faces exactly alike seemed never to have known a care it was as much as she could doas she confessed to Aunt Mattie afterwardsto keep herself from hugging them both I was looking for a picture she said that has a good subjectand thats well arrangedbut badly coloured The little old ladies glanced at each other in some alarm Calm yourself my dear said the one who had spoken first and try to remember which it was What _was_ the subject Was it an elephant for instance the other sister suggested They were still in sight of Lieutenant Brown I dont know indeed Clara impetuously replied You know it doesnt matter a bit what the subject _is_ so long as its a good one Once more the sisters exchanged looks of alarm and one of them whispered something to the other of which Clara caught only the one word mad They mean Aunt Mattie of course she said to herselffancying in her innocence that London was like her native town where everybody knew everybody else If you mean my aunt she added aloud shes _there_just three pictures beyond Lieutenant Brown Ah well Then youd better go to her my dear her new friend said soothingly _Shell_ find you the picture you want Goodbye dear Goodbye dear echoed the other sister Mind you dont lose sight of your aunt And the pair trotted off into another room leaving Clara rather perplexed at their manner Theyre real darlings she soliloquised I wonder why they pity me so And she wandered on murmuring to herself It must have two good marks and KNOT VI HER RADIANCY One piecee thing that my have got MaskeeA that thing my no can do You talkee you no sabey what Bamboo They landed and were at once conducted to the Palace About half way they were met by the Governor who welcomed them in Englisha great relief to our travellers whose guide could speak nothing but Kgovjnian I dont half like the way they grin at us as we go by the old man whispered to his son And why do they say Bamboo so often It alludes to a local custom replied the Governor who had overheard the question Such persons as happen in any way to displease Her Radiancy are usually beaten with rods Illustration WHY DO THEY SAY BAMBOO SO OFTEN The old man shuddered A most objectional local custom he remarked with strong emphasis I wish we had never landed Did you notice that black fellow Norman opening his great mouth at us I verily believe he would like to eat us Norman appealed to the Governor who was walking at his other side Do they often eat distinguished strangers here he said in as indifferent a tone as he could assume Not oftennot ever was the welcome reply They are not good for it Pigs we eat for they are fat This old man is thin And thankful to be so muttered the elder traveller Beaten we shall be without a doubt Its a comfort to know it wont be Beaten without the B My dear boy just look at the peacocks They were now walking between two unbroken lines of those gorgeous birds each held in check by means of a golden collar and chain by a black slave who stood well behind so as not to interrupt the view of the glittering tail with its network of rustling feathers and its hundred eyes The Governor smiled proudly In your honour he said Her Radiancy has ordered up ten thousand additional peacocks She will no doubt decorate you before you go with the usual Star and Feathers Itll be Star without the S faltered one of his hearers Come come Dont lose heart said the other All this is full of charm for me You are young Norman sighed his father young and lighthearted For me it is Charm without the C The old one is sad the Governor remarked with some anxiety He has without doubt effected some fearful crime But I havent the poor old gentleman hastily exclaimed Tell him I havent Norman He has not as yet Norman gently explained And the Governor repeated in a satisfied tone Not as yet Yours is a wondrous country the Governor resumed after a pause Now here is a letter from a friend of mine a merchant in London He and his brother went there a year ago with a thousand pounds apiece and on NewYearsday they had sixty thousand pounds between them How did they do it Norman eagerly exclaimed Even the elder traveller looked excited The Governor handed him the open letter Anybody can do it when once they know how so ran this oracular document We borrowed nought we stole nought We began the year with only a thousand pounds apiece and last NewYearsday we had sixty thousand pounds between ussixty thousand golden sovereigns Norman looked grave and thoughtful as he handed back the letter His father hazarded one guess Was it by gambling A Kgovjnian never gambles said the Governor gravely as he ushered them through the palace gates They followed him in silence down a long passage and soon found themselves in a lofty hall lined entirely with peacocks feathers In the centre was a pile of crimson cushions which almost concealed the figure of Her Radiancya plump little damsel in a robe of green satin dotted with silver stars whose pale round face lit up for a moment with a halfsmile as the travellers bowed before her and then relapsed into the exact expression of a wax doll while she languidly murmured a word or two in the Kgovjnian dialect The Governor interpreted Her Radiancy welcomes you She notes the Impenetrable Placidity of the old one and the Imperceptible Acuteness of the youth Here the little potentate clapped her hands and a troop of slaves instantly appeared carrying trays of coffee and sweetmeats which they offered to the guests who had at a signal from the Governor seated themselves on the carpet Sugarplums muttered the old man One might as well be at a confectioners Ask for a penny bun Norman Not so loud his son whispered Say something complimentary For the Governor was evidently expecting a speech We thank Her Exalted Potency the old man timidly began We bask in the light of her smile which The words of old men are weak the Governor interrupted angrily Let the youth speak Tell her cried Norman in a wild burst of eloquence that like two grasshoppers in a volcano we are shrivelled up in the presence of Her Spangled Vehemence It is well said the Governor and translated this into Kgovjnian I am now to tell you he proceeded what Her Radiancy requires of you before you go The yearly competition for the post of Imperial Scarfmaker is just ended you are the judges You will take account of the rate of work the lightness of the scarves and their warmth Usually the competitors differ in one point only Thus last year Fifi and Gogo made the same number of scarves in the trialweek and they were equally light but Fifis were twice as warm as Gogos and she was pronounced twice as good But this year woe is me who can judge it Three competitors are here and they differ in all points While you settle their claims you shall be lodged Her Radiancy bids me say free of expensein the best dungeon and abundantly fed on the best bread and water The old man groaned All is lost he wildly exclaimed But Norman heeded him not he had taken out his notebook and was calmly jotting down the particulars Three they be the Governor proceeded Lolo Mimi and Zuzu Lolo makes 5 scarves while Mimi makes 2 but Zuzu makes 4 while Lolo makes 3 Again so fairylike is Zuzus handiwork 5 of her scarves weigh no more than one of Lolos yet Mimis is lighter still5 of hers will but balance 3 of Zuzus And for warmth one of Mimis is equal to 4 of Zuzus yet one of Lolos is as warm as 3 of Mimis Here the little lady once more clapped her hands It is our signal of dismissal the Governor hastily said Pay Her Radiancy your farewell complimentsand walk out backwards The walking part was all the elder tourist could manage Norman simply said Tell Her Radiancy we are transfixed by the spectacle of Her Serene Brilliance and bid an agonized farewell to her Condensed Milkiness Her Radiancy is pleased the Governor reported after duly translating this She casts on you a glance from Her Imperial Eyes and is confident that you will catch it That I warrant we shall the elder traveller moaned to himself distractedly Once more they bowed low and then followed the Governor down a winding staircase to the Imperial Dungeon which they found to be lined with coloured marble lighted from the roof and splendidly though not luxuriously furnished with a bench of polished malachite I trust you will not delay the calculation the Governor said ushering them in with much ceremony I have known great inconveniencegreat and serious inconvenienceresult to those unhappy ones who have delayed to execute the commands of Her Radiancy And on this occasion she is resolute she says the thing must and shall be done and she has ordered up ten thousand additional bamboos With these words he left them and they heard him lock and bar the door on the outside I told you how it would end moaned the elder traveller wringing his hands and quite forgetting in his anguish that he had himself proposed the expedition and had never predicted anything of the sort Oh that we were well out of this miserable business Courage cried the younger cheerily _Hæc olim meminisse juvabit_ The end of all this will be glory Glory without the L was all the poor old man could say as he rocked himself to and fro on the malachite bench Glory without the L FOOTNOTE Footnote A _Maskee_ in PigeonEnglish means _without_ KNOT VII PETTY CASH Base is the slave that pays Aunt Mattie My child _Would_ you mind writing it down at once I shall be quite _certain_ to forget it if you dont My dear we really must wait till the cab stops How can I possibly write anything in the midst of all this jolting But _really_ I shall be forgetting it Claras voice took the plaintive tone that her aunt never knew how to resist and with a sigh the old lady drew forth her ivory tablets and prepared to record the amount that Clara had just spent at the confectioners shop Her expenditure was always made out of her aunts purse but the poor girl knew by bitter experience that sooner or later Mad Mathesis would expect an exact account of every penny that had gone and she waited with illconcealed impatience while the old lady turned the tablets over and over till she had found the one headed PETTY CASH Heres the place she said at last and here we have yesterdays luncheon duly entered _One glass lemonade_ Why cant you drink water like me _three sandwiches_ They never put in half mustard enough I told the young woman so to her face and she tossed her headlike her impudence _and seven biscuits_ _Total oneandtwopence_ Well now for todays One glass of lemonade Clara was beginning to say when suddenly the cab drew up and a courteous railwayporter was handing out the bewildered girl before she had had time to finish her sentence Her aunt pocketed the tablets instantly Business first she said petty cashwhich is a form of pleasure whatever _you_ may thinkafterwards And she proceeded to pay the driver and to give voluminous orders about the luggage quite deaf to the entreaties of her unhappy niece that she would enter the rest of the luncheon account My dear you really must cultivate a more capacious mind was all the consolation she vouchsafed to the poor girl Are not the tablets of your memory wide enough to contain the record of one single luncheon Not wide enough Not half wide enough was the passionate reply The words came in aptly enough but the voice was not that of Clara and both ladies turned in some surprise to see who it was that had so suddenly struck into their conversation A fat little old lady was standing at the door of a cab helping the driver to extricate what seemed an exact duplicate of herself it would have been no easy task to decide which was the fatter or which looked the more goodhumoured of the two sisters I tell you the cabdoor isnt half wide enough she repeated as her sister finally emerged somewhat after the fashion of a pellet from a popgun and she turned to appeal to Clara Is it dear she said trying hard to bring a frown into a face that dimpled all over with smiles Some folks is too wide for em growled the cabdriver Illustration I TELL YOU THE CABDOOR ISNT HALF WIDE ENOUGH Dont provoke me man cried the little old lady in what she meant for a tempest of fury Say another word and Ill put you into the County Court and sue you for a _Habeas Corpus_ The cabman touched his hat and marched off grinning Nothing like a little Law to cow the ruffians my dear she remarked confidentially to Clara You saw how he quailed when I mentioned the _Habeas Corpus_ Not that Ive any idea what it means but it sounds very grand doesnt it Its very provoking Clara replied a little vaguely Very the little old lady eagerly repeated And were very much provoked indeed Arent we sister I never was so provoked in all my life the fatter sister assented radiantly By this time Clara had recognised her picturegallery acquaintances and drawing her aunt aside she hastily whispered her reminiscences I met them first in the Royal Academyand they were very kind to meand they were lunching at the next table to us just now you knowand they tried to help me to find the picture I wantedand Im sure theyre dear old things Friends of yours are they said Mad Mathesis Well I like their looks You can be civil to them while I get the tickets But do try and arrange your ideas a little more chronologically And so it came to pass that the four ladies found themselves seated side by side on the same bench waiting for the train and chatting as if they had known one another for years Now this I call quite a remarkable coincidence exclaimed the smaller and more talkative of the two sistersthe one whose legal knowledge had annihilated the cabdriver Not only that we should be waiting for the same train and at the same station_that_ would be curious enoughbut actually on the same day and the same hour of the day Thats what strikes _me_ so forcibly She glanced at the fatter and more silent sister whose chief function in life seemed to be to support the family opinion and who meekly responded And me too sister Those are not _independent_ coincidences Mad Mathesis was just beginning when Clara ventured to interpose Theres no jolting here she pleaded meekly _Would_ you mind writing it down now Out came the ivory tablets once more What was it then said her aunt One glass of lemonade one sandwich one biscuitOh dear me cried poor Clara the historical tone suddenly changing to a wail of agony Toothache said her aunt calmly as she wrote down the items The two sisters instantly opened their reticules and produced two different remedies for neuralgia each marked unequalled It isnt that said poor Clara Thank you very much Its only that I _cant_ remember how much I paid Well try and make it out then said her aunt Youve got yesterdays luncheon to help you you know And heres the luncheon we had the day beforethe first day we went to that shop_one glass lemonade_ _four sandwiches_ _ten biscuits_ _Total oneandfivepence_ She handed the tablets to Clara who gazed at them with eyes so dim with tears that she did not at first notice that she was holding them upside down The two sisters had been listening to all this with the deepest interest and at this juncture the smaller one softly laid her hand on Claras arm Do you know my dear she said coaxingly my sister and I are in the very same predicament Quite identically the very same predicament Arent we sister Quite identically and absolutely the very began the fatter sister but she was constructing her sentence on too large a scale and the little one would not wait for her to finish it Yes my dear she resumed we were lunching at the very same shop as you wereand we had two glasses of lemonade and three sandwiches and five biscuitsand neither of us has the least idea what we paid Have we sister Quite identically and absolutely murmured the other who evidently considered that she was now a whole sentence in arrears and that she ought to discharge one obligation before contracting any fresh liabilities but the little lady broke in again and she retired from the conversation a bankrupt _Would_ you make it out for us my dear pleaded the little old lady You can do Arithmetic I trust her aunt said a little anxiously as Clara turned from one tablet to another vainly trying to collect her thoughts Her mind was a blank and all human expression was rapidly fading out of her face A gloomy silence ensued KNOT VIII DE OMNIBUS REBUS This little pig went to market This little pig staid at home By Her Radiancys express command said the Governor as he conducted the travellers for the last time from the Imperial presence I shall now have the ecstasy of escorting you as far as the outer gate of the Military Quarter where the agony of partingif indeed Nature can survive the shockmust be endured From that gate grurmstipths start every quarter of an hour both ways Would you mind repeating that word said Norman Grurm Grurmstipths the Governor repeated You call them omnibuses in England They run both ways and you can travel by one of them all the way down to the harbour The old man breathed a sigh of relief four hours of courtly ceremony had wearied him and he had been in constant terror lest something should call into use the ten thousand additional bamboos In another minute they were crossing a large quadrangle paved with marble and tastefully decorated with a pigsty in each corner Soldiers carrying pigs were marching in all directions and in the middle stood a gigantic officer giving orders in a voice of thunder which made itself heard above all the uproar of the pigs It is the CommanderinChief the Governor hurriedly whispered to his companions who at once followed his example in prostrating themselves before the great man The Commander gravely bowed in return He was covered with gold lace from head to foot his face wore an expression of deep misery and he had a little black pig under each arm Still the gallant fellow did his best in the midst of the orders he was every moment issuing to his men to bid a courteous farewell to the departing guests Farewell oh old onecarry these three to the South cornerand farewell to thee thou young oneput this fat one on the top of the others in the Western stymay your shadows never be lesswoe is me it is wrongly done Empty out all the sties and begin again And the soldier leant upon his sword and wiped away a tear He is in distress the Governor explained as they left the court Her Radiancy has commanded him to place twentyfour pigs in those four sties so that as she goes round the court she may always find the number in each sty nearer to ten than the number in the last Does she call ten nearer to ten than nine is said Norman Surely said the Governor Her Radiancy would admit that ten is nearer to ten than nine isand also nearer than eleven is Then I think it can be done said Norman The Governor shook his head The Commander has been transferring them in vain for four months he said What hope remains And Her Radiancy has ordered up ten thousand additional The pigs dont seem to enjoy being transferred the old man hastily interrupted He did not like the subject of bamboos They are only _provisionally_ transferred you know said the Governor In most cases they are immediately carried back again so they need not mind it And all is done with the greatest care under the personal superintendence of the CommanderinChief Of course she would only go _once_ round said Norman Alas no sighed their conductor Round and round Round and round These are Her Radiancys own words But oh agony Here is the outer gate and we must part He sobbed as he shook hands with them and the next moment was briskly walking away He _might_ have waited to see us off said the old man piteously And he neednt have begun whistling the very _moment_ he left us said the young one severely But look sharphere are two whatshisnames in the act of starting Unluckily the seabound omnibus was full Never mind said Norman cheerily Well walk on till the next one overtakes us They trudged on in silence both thinking over the military problem till they met an omnibus coming from the sea The elder traveller took out his watch Just twelve minutes and a half since we started he remarked in an absent manner Suddenly the vacant face brightened the old man had an idea My boy he shouted bringing his hand down upon Normans shoulder so suddenly as for a moment to transfer his centre of gravity beyond the base of support Thus taken off his guard the young man wildly staggered forwards and seemed about to plunge into space but in another moment he had gracefully recovered himself Problem in Precession and Nutation he remarkedin tones where filial respect only just managed to conceal a shade of annoyance What is it he hastily added fearing his father might have been taken ill Will you have some brandy When will the next omnibus overtake us When When the old man cried growing more excited every moment Norman looked gloomy Give me time he said I must think it over And once more the travellers passed on in silencea silence only broken by the distant squeals of the unfortunate little pigs who were still being provisionally transferred from sty to sty under the personal superintendence of the CommanderinChief KNOT IX A SERPENT WITH CORNERS Water water every where Nor any drop to drink Itll just take one more pebble What ever _are_ you doing with those buckets The speakers were Hugh and Lambert Place the beach of Little Mendip Time 130 PM Hugh was floating a bucket in another a size larger and trying how many pebbles it would carry without sinking Lambert was lying on his back doing nothing For the next minute or two Hugh was silent evidently deep in thought Suddenly he started I say look here Lambert he cried If its alive and slimy and with legs I dont care to said Lambert Didnt Balbus say this morning that if a body is immersed in liquid it displaces as much liquid as is equal to its own bulk said Hugh He said things of that sort Lambert vaguely replied Well just look here a minute Heres the little bucket almost quite immersed so the water displaced ought to be just about the same bulk And now just look at it He took out the little bucket as he spoke and handed the big one to Lambert Why theres hardly a teacupful Do you mean to say _that_ water is the same bulk as the little bucket Course it is said Lambert Well look here again cried Hugh triumphantly as he poured the water from the big bucket into the little one Why it doesnt half fill it Thats _its_ business said Lambert If Balbus says its the same bulk why it _is_ the same bulk you know Well I dont believe it said Hugh You neednt said Lambert Besides its dinnertime Come along They found Balbus waiting dinner for them and to him Hugh at once propounded his difficulty Lets get you helped first said Balbus briskly cutting away at the joint You know the old proverb Mutton first mechanics afterwards The boys did _not_ know the proverb but they accepted it in perfect good faith as they did every piece of information however startling that came from so infallible an authority as their tutor They ate on steadily in silence and when dinner was over Hugh set out the usual array of pens ink and paper while Balbus repeated to them the problem he had prepared for their afternoons task A friend of mine has a flowergardena very pretty one though no great size How big is it said Hugh Thats what _you_ have to find out Balbus gaily replied All _I_ tell you is that it is oblong in shapejust half a yard longer than its widthand that a gravelwalk one yard wide begins at one corner and runs all round it Joining into itself said Hugh _Not_ joining into itself young man Just before doing _that_ it turns a corner and runs round the garden again alongside of the first portion and then inside that again winding in and in and each lap touching the last one till it has used up the whole of the area Like a serpent with corners said Lambert Exactly so And if you walk the whole length of it to the last inch keeping in the centre of the path its exactly two miles and half a furlong Now while you find out the length and breadth of the garden Ill see if I can think out that seawater puzzle You said it was a flowergarden Hugh inquired as Balbus was leaving the room I did said Balbus Where do the flowers grow said Hugh But Balbus thought it best not to hear the question He left the boys to their problem and in the silence of his own room set himself to unravel Hughs mechanical paradox To fix our thoughts he murmured to himself as with hands deepburied in his pockets he paced up and down the room we will take a cylindrical glass jar with a scale of inches marked up the side and fill it with water up to the 10inch mark and we will assume that every inch depth of jar contains a pint of water We will now take a solid cylinder such that every inch of it is equal in bulk to _half_ a pint of water and plunge 4 inches of it into the water so that the end of the cylinder comes down to the 6inch mark Well that displaces 2 pints of water What becomes of them Why if there were no more cylinder they would lie comfortably on the top and fill the jar up to the 12inch mark But unfortunately there _is_ more cylinder occupying half the space between the 10inch and the 12inch marks so that only _one_ pint of water can be accommodated there What becomes of the other pint Why if there were no more cylinder it would lie on the top and fill the jar up to the 13inch mark But unfortunatelyShade of Newton he exclaimed in sudden accents of terror When _does_ the water stop rising A bright idea struck him Ill write a little essay on it he said _Balbuss Essay_ When a solid is immersed in a liquid it is well known that it displaces a portion of the liquid equal to itself in bulk and that the level of the liquid rises just so much as it would rise if a quantity of liquid had been added to it equal in bulk to the solid Lardner says precisely the same process occurs when a solid is _partially_ immersed the quantity of liquid displaced in this case equalling the portion of the solid which is immersed and the rise of the level being in proportion Suppose a solid held above the surface of a liquid and partially immersed a portion of the liquid is displaced and the level of the liquid rises But by this rise of level a little bit more of the solid is of course immersed and so there is a new displacement of a second portion of the liquid and a consequent rise of level Again this second rise of level causes a yet further immersion and by consequence another displacement of liquid and another rise It is selfevident that this process must continue till the entire solid is immersed and that the liquid will then begin to immerse whatever holds the solid which being connected with it must for the time be considered a part of it If you hold a stick six feet long with its end in a tumbler of water and wait long enough you must eventually be immersed The question as to the source from which the water is suppliedwhich belongs to a high branch of mathematics and is therefore beyond our present scopedoes not apply to the sea Let us therefore take the familiar instance of a man standing at the edge of the sea at ebbtide with a solid in his hand which he partially immerses he remains steadfast and unmoved and we all know that he must be drowned The multitudes who daily perish in this manner to attest a philosophical truth and whose bodies the unreasoning wave casts sullenly upon our thankless shores have a truer claim to be called the martyrs of science than a Galileo or a Kepler To use Kossuths eloquent phrase they are the unnamed demigods of the nineteenth centuryB Theres a fallacy _somewhere_ he murmured drowsily as he stretched his long legs upon the sofa I must think it over again He closed his eyes in order to concentrate his attention more perfectly and for the next hour or so his slow and regular breathing bore witness to the careful deliberation with which he was investigating this new and perplexing view of the subject Illustration HE REMAINS STEADFAST AND UNMOVED FOOTNOTE Footnote B _Note by the writer_For the above Essay I am indebted to a dear friend now deceased KNOT X CHELSEA BUNS Yea buns and buns and buns OLD SONG How very very sad exclaimed Clara and the eyes of the gentle girl filled with tears as she spoke Sadbut very curious when you come to look at it arithmetically was her aunts less romantic reply Some of them have lost an arm in their countrys service some a leg some an ear some an eye And some perhaps _all_ Clara murmured dreamily as they passed the long rows of weatherbeaten heroes basking in the sun Did you notice that very old one with a red face who was drawing a map in the dust with his wooden leg and all the others watching I _think_ it was a plan of a battle The battle of Trafalgar no doubt her aunt interrupted briskly Hardly that I think Clara ventured to say You see in that case he couldnt well be alive Couldnt well be alive the old lady contemptuously repeated Hes as lively as you and me put together Why if drawing a map in the dustwith ones wooden legdoesnt prove one to be alive perhaps youll kindly mention what _does_ prove it Clara did not see her way out of it Logic had never been her _forte_ To return to the arithmetic Mad Mathesis resumedthe eccentric old lady never let slip an opportunity of driving her niece into a calculationwhat percentage do you suppose must have lost all foura leg an arm an eye and an ear How _can_ I tell gasped the terrified girl She knew well what was coming You cant of course without _data_ her aunt replied but Im just going to give you Give her a Chelsea bun Miss Thats what most young ladies likes best The voice was rich and musical and the speaker dexterously whipped back the snowy cloth that covered his basket and disclosed a tempting array of the familiar square buns joined together in rows richly egged and browned and glistening in the sun No sir I shall give her nothing so indigestible Be off The old lady waved her parasol threateningly but nothing seemed to disturb the goodhumour of the jolly old man who marched on chanting his melodious refrain Music Chelsea buns Chelsea buns hot Chelsea buns Piping hot Chelsea buns hot Chelsea buns Far too indigestible my love said the old lady Percentages will agree with you ever so much better Clara sighed and there was a hungry look in her eyes as she watched the basket lessening in the distance but she meekly listened to the relentless old lady who at once proceeded to count off the _data_ on her fingers Say that 70 per cent have lost an eye75 per cent an ear80 per cent an arm85 per cent a legthatll do it beautifully Now my dear what percentage _at least_ must have lost all four No more conversation occurredunless a smothered exclamation of Piping hot which escaped from Claras lips as the basket vanished round a corner could be counted as suchuntil they reached the old Chelsea mansion where Claras father was then staying with his three sons and their old tutor Balbus Lambert and Hugh had entered the house only a few minutes before them They had been out walking and Hugh had been propounding a difficulty which had reduced Lambert to the depths of gloom and had even puzzled Balbus It changes from Wednesday to Thursday at midnight doesnt it Hugh had begun Sometimes said Balbus cautiously Always said Lambert decisively _Sometimes_ Balbus gently insisted Six midnights out of seven it changes to some other name I meant of course Hugh corrected himself when it _does_ change from Wednesday to Thursday it does it at midnightand _only_ at midnight Surely said Balbus Lambert was silent Well now suppose its midnight here in Chelsea Then its Wednesday _west_ of Chelsea say in Ireland or America where midnight hasnt arrived yet and its Thursday _east_ of Chelsea say in Germany or Russia where midnight has just passed by Surely Balbus said again Even Lambert nodded this time But it isnt midnight anywhere else so it cant be changing from one day to another anywhere else And yet if Ireland and America and so on call it Wednesday and Germany and Russia and so on call it Thursday there _must_ be some placenot Chelseathat has different days on the two sides of it And the worst of it is the people _there_ get their days in the wrong order theyve got Wednesday _east_ of them and Thursday _west_just as if their day had changed from Thursday to Wednesday Ive heard that puzzle before cried Lambert And Ill tell you the explanation When a ship goes round the world from east to west we know that it loses a day in its reckoning so that when it gets home and calls its day Wednesday it finds people here calling it Thursday because weve had one more midnight than the ship has had And when you go the other way round you gain a day I know all that said Hugh in reply to this not very lucid explanation but it doesnt help me because the ship hasnt proper days One way round you get more than twentyfour hours to the day and the other way you get less so of course the names get wrong but people that live on in one place always get twentyfour hours to the day I suppose there _is_ such a place Balbus said meditatively though I never heard of it And the people must find it very queer as Hugh says to have the old day _east_ of them and the new one _west_ because when midnight comes round to them with the new day in front of it and the old one behind it one doesnt see exactly what happens I must think it over So they had entered the house in the state I have describedBalbus puzzled and Lambert buried in gloomy thought Yes mm Master _is_ at home mm said the stately old butler NBIt is only a butler of experience who can manage a series of three Ms together without any interjacent vowels And the _ole_ party is awaiting for you in the libery I dont like his calling your father an _old_ party Mad Mathesis whispered to her niece as they crossed the hall And Clara had only just time to whisper in reply he meant the _whole_ party before they were ushered into the library and the sight of the five solemn faces there assembled chilled her into silence Her father sat at the head of the table and mutely signed to the ladies to take the two vacant chairs one on each side of him His three sons and Balbus completed the party Writing materials had been arranged round the table after the fashion of a ghostly banquet the butler had evidently bestowed much thought on the grim device Sheets of quarto paper each flanked by a pen on one side and a pencil on the other represented the platespenwipers did duty for rolls of breadwhile inkbottles stood in the places usually occupied by wineglasses The _pièce de resistance_ was a large green baize bag which gave forth as the old man restlessly lifted it from side to side a charming jingle as of innumerable golden guineas Sister daughter sonsand Balbus the old man began so nervously that Balbus put in a gentle Hear hear while Hugh drummed on the table with his fists This disconcerted the unpractised orator Sister he began again then paused a moment moved the bag to the other side and went on with a rush I meanthis beinga critical occasionmore or lessbeing the year when one of my sons comes of age he paused again in some confusion having evidently got into the middle of his speech sooner than he intended but it was too late to go back Hear hear cried Balbus Quite so said the old gentleman recovering his selfpossession a little when first I began this annual custommy friend Balbus will correct me if I am wrong Hugh whispered with a strap but nobody heard him except Lambert who only frowned and shook his head at him this annual custom of giving each of my sons as many guineas as would represent his ageit was a critical timeso Balbus informed meas the ages of two of you were together equal to that of the thirdso on that occasion I made a speech He paused so long that Balbus thought it well to come to the rescue with the words It was a most but the old man checked him with a warning look yes made a speech he repeated A few years after that Balbus pointed outI say pointed out Hear hear cried Balbus Quite so said the grateful old man that it was _another_ critical occasion The ages of two of you were together _double_ that of the third So I made another speechanother speech And now again its a critical occasionso Balbus saysand I am making Here Mad Mathesis pointedly referred to her watch all the haste I can the old man cried with wonderful presence of mind Indeed sister Im coming to the point now The number of years that have passed since that first occasion is just twothirds of the number of guineas I then gave you Now my boys calculate your ages from the _data_ and you shall have the money But we _know_ our ages cried Hugh Silence sir thundered the old man rising to his full height he was exactly fivefoot five in his indignation I say you must use the _data_ only You mustnt even assume _which_ it is that comes of age He clutched the bag as he spoke and with tottering steps it was about as much as he could do to carry it he left the room And _you_ shall have a similar _cadeau_ the old lady whispered to her niece when youve calculated that percentage And she followed her brother Nothing could exceed the solemnity with which the old couple had risen from the table and yet was itwas it a _grin_ with which the father turned away from his unhappy sons Could it becould it be a _wink_ with which the aunt abandoned her despairing niece And were thosewere those sounds of suppressed _chuckling_ which floated into the room just before Balbus who had followed them out closed the door Surely not and yet the butler told the cookbut no that was

oclock till 9 in walking along a level road up a hill and home again their pace on the level being 4 miles an hour up hill 3 and down hill 6 Find distance walked also within half an hour time of reaching top of hill _Answer_24 miles halfpast 6 _Solution_A level mile takes 14 of an hour up hill 13 down hill 16 Hence to go and return over the same mile whether on the level or on the hillside takes 12 an hour Hence in 6 hours they went 12 miles out and 12 back If the 12 miles out had been nearly all level they would have taken a little over 3 hours if nearly all up hill a little under 4 Hence 312 hours must be within 12 an hour of the time taken in reaching the peak thus as they started at 3 they got there within 12 an hour of 12 past 6 Twentyseven answers have come in Of these 9 are right 16 partially right and 2 wrong The 16 give the _distance_ correctly but they have failed to grasp the fact that the top of the hill might have been reached at _any_ moment between 6 oclock and 7 The two wrong answers are from GERTY VERNON and A NIHILIST The former makes the distance 23 miles while her revolutionary companion puts it at 27 GERTY VERNON says they had to go 4 miles along the plain and got to the foot of the hill at 4 oclock They _might_ have done so I grant but you have no ground for saying they _did_ so It was 712 miles to the top of the hill and they reached that at 14 before 7 oclock Here you go wrong in your arithmetic and I must however reluctantly bid you farewell 712 miles at 3 miles an hour would _not_ require 234 hours A NIHILIST says Let _x_ denote the whole number of miles _y_ the number of hours to hilltop therefore 3_y_ number of miles to hilltop and _x_3_y_ number of miles on the other side You bewilder me The other side of _what_ Of the hill you say But then how did they get home again However to accommodate your views we will build a new hostelry at the foot of the hill on the opposite side and also assume what I grant you is _possible_ though it is not _necessarily_ true that there was no level road at all Even then you go wrong You say _y_ 6 _x_ 3_y_6 i _x_412 6 ii I grant you i but I deny ii it rests on the assumption that to go _part_ of the time at 3 miles an hour and the rest at 6 miles an hour comes to the same result as going the _whole_ time at 412 miles an hour But this would only be true if the _part_ were an exact _half_ ie if they went up hill for 3 hours and down hill for the other 3 which they certainly did _not_ do The sixteen who are partially right are AGNES BAILEY F K FIFEE G E B H P KIT M E T MYSIE A MOTHERS SON

particular assumptions such as that there was no level roadthat there were 6 miles of level roadand so on all leading to _particular_ times being fixed for reaching the hilltop The most curious assumption is that of AGNES BAILEY who says Let _x_ number of hours occupied in ascent then _x_2 hours occupied in descent and 4_x_3 hours occupied on the level I suppose you were thinking of the relative _rates_ up hill and on the level which we might express by saying that if they went _x_ miles up hill in a certain time they would go 4_x_3 miles on the level _in the same time_ You have in fact assumed that they took _the same time_ on the level that they took in ascending the hill FIFEE assumes that when the aged knight said they had gone four miles in the hour on the level he meant that four miles was the _distance_ gone not merely the rate This would have beenif FIFEE will excuse the slang expressiona sell illsuited to the dignity of the hero And now descend ye classic Nine who

other traveller How many did each meet _Answers_1 19 2 The easterly traveller met 12 the other 8 The trains one way took 180 minutes the other way 120 Let us take the L C M 360 and divide the railway into 360 units Then one set of trains went at the rate of 2 units a minute and at intervals of 30 units the other at the rate of 3 units a minute and at intervals of 45 units An easterly train starting has 45 units between it and the first train it will meet it does 25ths of this while the other does 35ths and thus meets it at the end of 18 units and so all the way round A westerly train starting has 30 units between it and the first train it will meet it does 35ths of this while the other does 25ths and thus meets it at the end of 18 units and so all the way round Hence if the railway be divided by 19 posts into 20 parts each containing 18 units trains meet at every post and in 1 each traveller passes 19 posts in going round and so meets 19 trains But in 2 the easterly traveller only begins to count after traversing 25ths of the journey _ie_ on reaching the 8th post and so counts 12 posts similarly the other counts 8 They meet at the end of 25ths of 3 hours or 35ths

THISTLEDOWN TOMQUAD and an unsigned one BOPEEP rightly says that the easterly traveller met all trains which started during the 3 hours of her trip as well as all which started during the previous 2 hours _ie_ all which started at the commencements of 20 periods of 15 minutes each and she is right in striking out the one she met at the moment of starting but wrong in striking out the _last_ train for she did not meet this at the terminus but 15 minutes before she got there She makes the same mistake in 2 FINANCIER thinks that any train met for the second time is not to be counted I W T finds by a process which is not stated that the travellers met at the end of 71 minutes and 2612 seconds KATE B thinks the trains which are met on starting and on arriving are _never_ to be counted even when met elsewhere Q Y Z tries a rather complex algebraical solution and succeeds in finding the time of meeting correctly all else is wrong SEAGULL seems to think that in 1 the easterly train _stood still_ for 3 hours and says that in 2 the travellers met at the end of 71 minutes 40 seconds THISTLEDOWN nobly confesses to having tried no calculation but merely having drawn a picture of the railway and counted the trains in 1 she counts wrong in 2 she makes them meet in 75 minutes TOMQUAD omits 1 in 2 he makes Clara count the train she met on her arrival The unsigned one is also unintelligible it states that the travellers go 124th more than the total distance to be traversed The Clara theory already referred to is adopted by 5 of these viz BOPEEP FINANCIER KATE B TOMQUAD and the nameless

OLD MAID get 20 as answer for 1 by forgetting to strike out the train met on arrival The others all get 18 in various ways BOGOAK GUY and R W divide the trains which the westerly traveller has to meet into 2 sets viz those already on the line which they rightly make 11 and those which started during her 2 hours journey exclusive of train met on arrival which they wrongly make 7 and they make a similar mistake with the easterly train BRIDGET rightly says that the westerly traveller met a train every 6 minutes for 2 hours but wrongly makes the number 20 it should be 21 G E B adopts BOPEEPS

3 numbers fulfilling these conditions it is perhaps simplest to take the one that occurs _twice_ as unity and reduce the others to fractions this gives for _L_ _M_ and _Z_ the marks 1 25 43 In estimating for _lightness_ we observe that the greater the weight the less the merit so that _Z_s merit is to _L_s as 5 to 1 Thus the marks for _lightness_ are 15 53 1 And similarly the marks for

hapless ones have all with three exceptions fallen into the error of _adding_ the proportional numbers together for each candidate instead of _multiplying_ _Why_ the latter is right rather than the former is fully proved in textbooks so I will not occupy space by stating it here but it can be _illustrated_ very easily by the case of length breadth and depth Suppose _A_ and _B_ are rival diggers of rectangular tanks the amount of work done is evidently measured by the number of _cubical feet_ dug out Let _A_ dig a tank 10 feet long 10 wide 2 deep let _B_ dig one 6 feet long 5 wide 10 deep The

simplicity and beguiled her with the chaff which was the bane of her own chickenhood Secondly I point the finger of scorn at those who have put the worst candidate at the top arranging them as Zuzu Mimi Lolo They are GRAECIA M M OLD CAT and R E X Tis Greece but The third set have avoided both these enormities and have even succeeded in putting the worst last their answer being Lolo Mimi Zuzu Their names are AYR who also appears among the quite too too CLIFTON C F B FIFEE GRIG JANET and MRS SAIREY GAMP F B has not fallen into the common error she _multiplies_ together the proportionate numbers she gets but in getting them she goes wrong by reckoning warmth as a _de_merit Possibly she is Freshly Burnt or comes From Bombay JANET and MRS SAIREY GAMP have also avoided this error the method they have adopted is shrouded in mysteryI scarcely feel competent to criticize it MRS GAMP says if Zuzu makes 4 while Lolo makes 3 Zuzu makes 6 while Lolo makes 5 bad reasoning while Mimi makes 2 From this she concludes therefore Zuzu excels in speed by 1 _ie_ when compared with Lolo but what about Mimi She then compares the 3 kinds of excellence measured on this mystic scale JANET takes the statement that Lolo makes 5 while Mimi makes 2 to prove that Lolo makes 3 while Mimi makes 1 and Zuzu 4 worse reasoning than MRS GAMPS and thence concludes that Zuzu excels in speed by 18 JANET should have been ADELINE mystery of mysteries The fourth set actually put Mimi at the top arranging them as Mimi Zuzu Lolo They are MARQUIS AND CO MARTREB S B B first initial scarcely legible _may_ be meant for J and STANZA The fifth set consist of AN ANCIENT FISH and CAMEL These illassorted comrades by dint of foot and fin have scrambled into the right answer but as their method is wrong of course it counts for nothing Also AN ANCIENT FISH has very ancient and fishlike ideas as to _how_ numbers represent merit she says Lolo gains 212 on Mimi Two and a half _what_ Fish fish art thou in thy duty Of the five winners I put BALBUS and THE ELDER TRAVELLER slightly below the other threeBALBUS for defective reasoning the other for scanty working BALBUS gives two reasons for saying that _addition_ of marks is _not_ the right method and then adds it follows that the decision must be made by _multiplying_ the marks together This is hardly more logical than to say This is not Spring _therefore_ it must be Autumn CLASS LIST I DINAH MITE E B D L JORAM II BALBUS THE ELDER TRAVELLER With regard to Knot V I beg to express to VIS INERTIÆ and to any others who like her understood the condition to be that _every_ marked picture must have _three_ marks my sincere regret that the unfortunate phrase _fill_ the columns with oughts and crosses should have caused them to waste so much time and trouble I can only repeat that a _literal_ interpretation of fill would seem to _me_ to require that _every_ picture in the gallery should be marked VIS INERTIÆ would have been in the First Class if she had sent in the solution she now offers ANSWERS TO KNOT VII _Problem_Given that one glass of lemonade 3 sandwiches and 7 biscuits cost 1_s_ 2_d_ and that one glass of lemonade 4 sandwiches and 10 biscuits cost 1_s_ 5_d_ find the cost of 1 a glass of lemonade a sandwich and a biscuit and 2 2 glasses of lemonade 3 sandwiches and 5 biscuits _Answer_1 8_d_ 2 1_s_ 7_d_ _Solution_This is best treated algebraically Let _x_ the cost in pence of a glass of lemonade _y_ of a sandwich and _z_ of a biscuit Then we have _x_ 3_y_ 7_z_ 14 and _x_ 4_y_ 10_z_ 17 And we require the values of _x_ _y_ _z_ and of 2_x_ 3_y_ 5_z_ Now from _two_ equations only we cannot find _separately_ the values of _three_ unknowns certain _combinations_ of them may however be found Also we know that we can by the help of the given equations eliminate 2 of the 3 unknowns from the quantity whose value is required which will then contain one only If then the required value is ascertainable at all it can only be by the 3rd unknown vanishing of itself otherwise the problem is impossible Let us then eliminate lemonade and sandwiches and reduce everything to biscuitsa state of things even more depressing than if all the world were applepieby subtracting the 1st equation from the 2nd which eliminates lemonade and gives _y_ 3_z_ 3 or _y_ 33_z_ and then substituting this value of _y_ in the 1st which gives _x_2_z_ 5 _ie_ _x_ 5 2_z_ Now if we substitute these values of _x_ _y_ in the quantities whose values are required the first becomes 5 2_z_ 33_z_ _z_ _ie_ 8 and the second becomes 25 2_z_ 333_z_ 5_z_ _ie_ 19 Hence the answers are 1 8_d_ 2 1_s_ 7_d_ The above is a _universal_ method that is it is absolutely certain either to produce the answer or to prove that no answer is possible The question may also be solved by combining the quantities whose values are given so as to form those whose values are required This is merely a matter of ingenuity and good luck and as it _may_ fail even when the thing is possible and is of no use in proving it _im_possible I cannot rank this method as equal in value with the other Even when it succeeds it may prove a very tedious process Suppose the 26 competitors who have sent in what I may call _accidental_ solutions had had a question to deal with where every number contained 8 or 10 digits I suspect it would have been a case of silvered is the raven hair see Patience before any solution would have been hit on by the most ingenious of them Fortyfive answers have come in of which 44 give I am happy to say some sort of _working_ and therefore deserve to be mentioned by name and to have their virtues or vices as the case may be discussed Thirteen have made assumptions to which they have no right and so cannot figure in the Classlist even though in 10 of the 13 cases the answer is right Of the remaining 28 no less than 26 have sent in _accidental_ solutions and therefore fall short of the highest honours I will now discuss individual cases taking the worst first as my custom is FROGGY gives no workingat least this is all he gives after stating the given equations he says therefore the difference 1 sandwich 3 biscuits 3_d_ then follow the amounts of the unknown bills with no further hint as to how he got them FROGGY has had a _very_ narrow escape of not being named at all Of those who are wrong VIS INERTIÆ has sent in a piece of incorrect working Peruse the horrid details and shudder She takes _x_ call it _y_ as the cost of a sandwich and concludes rightly enough that a biscuit will cost 3_y_3 She then subtracts the second equation from the first and deduces 3_y_ 7 3_y_34_y_ 10 3_y_3 3 By making two mistakes in this line she brings out _y_ 32 Try it again oh VIS INERTIÆ Away with INERTIÆ infuse a little more VIS and you will bring out the correct though uninteresting result 0 0 This will show you that it is hopeless to try to coax any one of these 3 unknowns to reveal its _separate_ value The other competitor who is wrong throughout is either J M C or T M C but whether he be a Juvenile MisCalculator or a True Mathematician Confused he makes the answers 7_d_ and 1_s_ 5_d_ He assumes with Too Much Confidence that biscuits were 12_d_ each and that Clara paid for 8 though she only ate 7 We will now consider the 13 whose working is wrong though the answer is right and not to measure their demerits too exactly I will take them in alphabetical order ANITA finds rightly that 1 sandwich and 3 biscuits cost 3_d_ and proceeds therefore 1 sandwich 112_d_ 3 biscuits 112_d_ 1 lemonade 6_d_ DINAH MITE begins like ANITA and thence proves rightly that a biscuit costs less than a 1_d_ whence she concludes wrongly that it _must_ cost 12_d_ F C W is so beautifully resigned to the certainty of a verdict of guilty that I have hardly the heart to utter the word without adding a recommended to mercy owing to extenuating circumstances But really you know where _are_ the extenuating circumstances She begins by assuming that lemonade is 4_d_ a glass and sandwiches 3_d_ each making with the 2 given equations _four_ conditions to be fulfilled by _three_ miserable unknowns And having naturally developed this into a contradiction she then tries 5_d_ and 2_d_ with a similar result NB _This_ process might have been carried on through the whole of the Tertiary Period without gratifying one single Megatherium She then by a happy thought tries halfpenny biscuits and so obtains a consistent result This may be a good solution viewing the problem as a conundrum but it is _not_ scientific JANET identifies sandwiches with biscuits One sandwich 3 biscuits she makes equal to 4 Four _what_ MAYFAIR makes the astounding assertion that the equation _s_ 3_b_ 3 is evidently only satisfied by _s_ 32 _b_ 12 OLD CAT believes that the assumption that a sandwich costs 112_d_ is the only way to avoid unmanageable fractions But _why_ avoid them Is there not a certain glow of triumph in taming such a fraction Ladies and gentlemen the fraction now before you is one that for years defied all efforts of a refining nature it was in a word hopelessly vulgar Treating it as a circulating decimal the treadmill of fractions only made matters worse As a last resource I reduced it to its lowest terms and extracted its square root Joking apart let me thank OLD CAT for some very kind words of sympathy in reference to a correspondent whose name I am happy to say I have now forgotten who had found fault with me as a discourteous critic O V L is beyond my comprehension He takes the given equations as 1 and 2 thence by the process 21 deduces rightly equation 3 viz _s_ 3_b_ 3 and thence again by the process 33 a hopeless mystery deduces 3_s_ 4_b_ 4 I have nothing to say about it I give it up SEABREEZE says it is immaterial to the answer why in what proportion 3_d_ is divided between the sandwich and the 3 biscuits so she assumes _s_ l12_d_ _b_ 12_d_ STANZA is one of a very irregular metre At first she like JANET identifies sandwiches with biscuits She then tries two assumptions _s_ 1 _b_ 23 and _s_ 12 _b_ 56 and naturally ends in contradictions Then she returns to the first assumption and finds the 3 unknowns separately _quod est absurdum_ STILETTO identifies sandwiches and biscuits as articles Is the word ever used by confectioners I fancied What is the next article Maam was limited to linendrapers TWO SISTERS first assume that biscuits are 4 a penny and then that they are 2 a penny adding that the answer will of course be the same in both cases It is a dreamy remark making one feel something like Macbeth grasping at the spectral dagger Is this a statement that I see before me If you were to say we both walked the same way this morning and _I_ were to say _one_ of you walked the same way but the other didnt which of the three would be the most hopelessly confused TURTLE PYATE what _is_ a Turtle Pyate please and OLD CROW who send a joint answer and Y Y adopt the same method Y Y gets the equation _s_ 3_b_ 3 and then says this sum must be apportioned in one of the three following ways It _may_ be I grant you but Y Y do you say must I fear it is _possible_ for Y Y to be _two_ Ys The other two conspirators are less positive they say it can be so divided but they add either of the three prices being right This is bad grammar and bad arithmetic at once oh mysterious birds Of those who win honours THE SHETLAND SNARK must have the 3rd class all to himself He has only answered half the question viz the amount of Claras luncheon the two little old ladies he pitilessly leaves in the midst of their difficulty I beg to assure him with thanks for his friendly remarks that entrancefees and subscriptions are things unknown in that most economical of clubs The KnotUntiers The authors of the 26 accidental solutions differ only in the number of steps they have taken between the _data_ and the answers In order to do them full justice I have arranged the 2nd class in sections according to the number of steps The two Kings are fearfully deliberate I suppose walking quick or taking short cuts is inconsistent with kingly dignity but really in reading THESEUS solution one almost fancied he was marking time and making no advance at all The other King will I hope pardon me for having altered Coal into Cole King Coilus or Coil seems to have reigned soon after Arthurs time Henry of Huntingdon identifies him with the King Coël who first built walls round Colchester which was named after him In the Chronicle of Robert of Gloucester we read Aftur Kyng Aruirag of wam we habbeth y told Marius ys sone was kyng quoynte mon bold And ys sone was aftur hym _Coil_ was ys name Bothe it were quoynte men of noble fame BALBUS lays it down as a general principle that in order to ascertain the cost of any one luncheon it must come to the same amount upon two different assumptions _Query_ Should not it be we Otherwise the _luncheon_ is represented as wishing to ascertain its own cost He then makes two assumptionsone that sandwiches cost nothing the other that biscuits cost nothing either arrangement would lead to the shop being inconveniently crowdedand brings out the unknown luncheons as 8_d_ and 19_d_ on each assumption He then concludes that this agreement of results shows that the answers are correct Now I propose to disprove his general law by simply giving _one_ instance of its failing One instance is quite enough In logical language in order to disprove a universal affirmative it is enough to prove its contradictory which is a particular negative I must pause for a digression on Logic and especially on Ladies Logic The universal affirmative everybody says hes a duck is crushed instantly by proving the particular negative Peter says hes a goose which is equivalent to Peter does _not_ say hes a duck And the universal negative nobody calls on her is well met by the particular affirmative _I_ called yesterday In short either of two contradictories disproves the other and the moral is that since a particular proposition is much more easily proved than a universal one it is the wisest course in arguing with a Lady to limit ones _own_ assertions to particulars and leave _her_ to prove the universal contradictory if she can You will thus generally secure a _logical_ victory a _practical_ victory is not to be hoped for since she can always fall back upon the crushing remark _that_ has nothing to do with ita move for which Man has not yet discovered any satisfactory answer Now let us return to BALBUS Here is my particular negative on which to test his rule Suppose the two recorded luncheons to have been 2 buns one queencake 2 sausagerolls and a bottle of Zoëdone total oneandninepence and one bun 2 queencakes a sausageroll and a bottle of Zoëdone total oneandfourpence And suppose Claras unknown luncheon to have been 3 buns one queencake one sausageroll and 2 bottles of Zoëdone while the two little sisters had been indulging in 8 buns 4 queencakes 2 sausagerolls and 6 bottles of Zoëdone Poor souls how thirsty they must have been If BALBUS will kindly try this by his principle of two assumptions first assuming that a bun is 1_d_ and a queencake 2_d_ and then that a bun is 3_d_ and a queencake 3_d_ he will bring out the other two luncheons on each assumption as oneandninepence and fourandtenpence respectively which harmony of results he will say shows that the answers are correct And yet as a matter of fact the buns were 2_d_ each the queencakes 3_d_ the sausagerolls 6_d_ and the Zoëdone 2_d_ a bottle so that Claras third luncheon had cost oneandsevenpence and her thirsty friends had spent fourandfourpence Another remark of BALBUS I will quote and discuss for I think that it also may yield a moral for some of my readers He says it is the same thing in substance whether in solving this problem we use words and call it Arithmetic or use letters and signs and call it Algebra Now this does not appear to me a correct description of the two methods the Arithmetical method is that of synthesis only it goes from one known fact to another till it reaches its goal whereas the Algebraical method is that of analysis it begins with the goal symbolically represented and so goes backwards dragging its veiled victim with it till it has reached the full daylight of known facts in which it can tear off the veil and say I know you Take an illustration Your house has been broken into and robbed and you appeal to the policeman who was on duty that night Well Mum I did see a chap getting out over your gardenwall but I was a good bit off so I didnt chase him like I just cut down the short way to the Chequers and who should I meet but Bill Sykes coming full split round the corner So I just ups and says My lad youre wanted Thats all I says And he says Ill go along quiet Bobby he says without the darbies he says Theres your _Arithmetical_ policeman Now try the other method I seed somebody a running but he was well gone or ever _I_ got nigh the place So I just took a look round in the garden And I noticed the footmarks where the chap had come right across your flowerbeds They was good big footmarks surely And I noticed as the left foot went down at the heel ever so much deeper than the other And I says to myself The chaps been a big hulking chap and he goes lame on his left foot And I rubs my hand on the wall where he got over and there was soot on it and no mistake So I says to myself Now where can I light on a big man in the chimbleysweep line whats lame of one foot And I flashes up permiscuous and I says Its Bill Sykes says I There is your _Algebraical_ policemana higher intellectual type to my thinking than the other LITTLE JACKS solution calls for a word

Knots II and VI which lead me to think some further explanation desirable In Knot II I had intended the numbering of the houses to begin at one corner of the Square and this was assumed by most if not all of the competitors TROJANUS however says assuming in default of any information that the street enters the square in the middle of each side it may be supposed that the numbering begins at a street But surely the other is the more natural assumption In Knot VI the first Problem was of course a mere _jeu de mots_ whose presence I thought excusable in a series of Problems whose aim is to entertain rather than to instruct but it has not escaped the contemptuous criticisms of two of my correspondents who seem to think that Apollo is in duty bound to keep his bow always on the stretch Neither of them has guessed it and this is true human nature Only the other daythe 31st of September to be quite exactI met my old friend Brown and gave him a riddle I had just heard With one great effort of his colossal mind Brown guessed it Right said I Ah said he its very neatvery neat And it isnt an answer that would occur to everybody Very neat indeed A few yards further on I fell in with Smith and to him I propounded the same riddle He frowned over it for a minute and then gave it up Meekly I faltered out the answer A poor thing sir Smith growled as he turned away A very poor thing I wonder you care to repeat such rubbish Yet Smiths mind is if possible even more colossal than Browns The second Problem of Knot VI is an example in ordinary Double Rule of Three whose essential feature is that the result depends on the variation of several elements which are so related to it that if all but one be constant it varies as that one hence if none be constant it varies as their product Thus for example the cubical contents of a rectangular tank vary as its length if breadth and depth be constant and so on hence if none be constant it varies as the product of the length breadth and depth When the result is not thus connected with the varying elements the Problem ceases to be Double Rule of Three and often becomes one of great complexity To illustrate this let us take two candidates for a prize _A_ and _B_ who are to compete in French German and Italian _a_ Let it be laid down that the result is to depend on their _relative_ knowledge of each subject so that whether their marks for French be 1 2 or 100 200 the result will be the same and let it also be laid down that if they get equal marks on 2 papers the final marks are to have the same ratio as those of the 3rd paper This is a case of ordinary Double Rule of Three We multiply _A_s 3 marks together and do the same for _B_ Note that if _A_ gets a single 0 his final mark is 0 even if he gets full marks for 2 papers while _B_ gets only one mark for each paper This of course would be very unfair on _A_ though a correct solution under the given conditions _b_ The result is to depend as before on _relative_ knowledge but French is to have twice as much weight as German or Italian This is an unusual form of question I should be inclined to say the resulting ratio is to be nearer to the French ratio than if we multiplied as in _a_ and so much nearer that it would be necessary to use the other multipliers _twice_ to produce the same result as in _a_ _eg_ if the French Ratio were 910 and the others 49 19 so that the ultimate ratio by method _a_ would be 245 I should multiply instead by 23 13 giving the result 13 which is nearer to 910 than if he had used method _a_ _c_ The result is to depend on _actual_ amount of knowledge of the 3 subjects collectively Here we have to ask two questions 1 What is to be the unit _ie_ standard to measure by in each subject 2 Are these units to be of equal or unequal value The usual unit is the knowledge shown by answering the whole paper correctly calling this 100 all lower amounts are represented by numbers between 0 and 100 Then if these units are to be of equal value we simply add _A_s 3 marks together and do the same for _B_ _d_ The conditions are the same as _c_ but French is to have double weight Here we simply double the French marks and add as before _e_ French is to have such weight that if other marks be equal the ultimate ratio is to be that of the French paper so that a 0 in this would swamp the candidate but the other two subjects are only to affect the result collectively by the amount of knowledge shown the two being reckoned of equal value Here I should add _A_s German and Italian marks together and multiply by his French mark But I need not go on the problem may evidently be set with many varying conditions each requiring its own method of solution The Problem in Knot VI was meant to belong to variety _a_ and to make this clear I inserted the following passage Usually the competitors differ in one point only Thus last year Fifi and Gogo made the same number of scarves in the trial week and they were equally light but Fifis were twice as warm as Gogos and she was pronounced twice as good What I have said will suffice I hope as an answer to BALBUS who holds that _a_ and _c_ are the only possible varieties of the problem and that to say We cannot use addition therefore we must be intended to use multiplication is no more illogical than from knowledge that one was not born in the night to infer that he was born in the daytime and also to FIFEE who says I think a little more consideration will show you that our error of _adding_ the proportional numbers together for each candidate instead of _multiplying_ is no error at all Why even if addition _had_ been the right method to use not one of the writers I speak from memory showed any consciousness of the necessity of fixing a unit for each subject No error at all They were positively steeped in error One correspondent I do not name him as the communication is not quite friendly in tone writes thusI wish to add very respectfully that I think it would be in better taste if you were to abstain from the very trenchant expressions which you are accustomed to indulge in when criticising the answer That such a tone must not be be not agreeable to the persons concerned who have made mistakes may possibly have no great weight with you but I hope you will feel that it would be as well not to employ it _unless you are quite certain of being correct yourself_ The only instances the writer gives of the trenchant expressions are hapless and malefactors I beg to assure him and any others who may need the assurance I trust there are none that all such words have been used in jest and with no idea that they could possibly annoy any one and that I sincerely regret any annoyance I may have thus inadvertently given May I hope that in future they will recognise the distinction between severe language used in sober earnest and the words of unmeant bitterness which Coleridge has alluded to in that lovely passage beginning A little child a limber elf If the writer will refer to that passage or to the preface to Fire Famine and Slaughter he will find the distinction for which I plead far better drawn out than I could hope to do in any words of mine The writers insinuation that I care not how much annoyance I give to my readers I think it best to pass over in silence but to his concluding remark I must entirely demur I hold that to use language likely to annoy any of my correspondents would not be in the least justified by the plea that I was quite certain of being correct I trust that the knotuntiers and I are not on such terms as those I beg to thank _G B_ for the offer of a puzzlewhich however is too like the old one Make four 9s into 100 ANSWERS TO KNOT VIII 1 THE PIGS _Problem_Place twentyfour pigs in four

minutes when will he be overtaken by one _Answer_In 614 minutes _Solution_Let _a_ be the distance an omnibus goes in 15 minutes and _x_ the distance from the startingpoint to where the traveller is overtaken Since the omnibus met is due at the startingpoint in 212 minutes it goes in that time as far as the traveller walks in 1212 _ie_ it goes 5 times as fast Now the overtaking omnibus is _a_ behind the traveller when he starts and therefore goes _a_ _x_ while he goes _x_ Hence _a_ _x_ 5_x_ _ie_ 4_x_ _a_ and _x_ _a_4 This distance would be traversed by an omnibus in 154 minutes and therefore by the traveller in 5 154 Hence he is overtaken in 1834 minutes after starting _ie_ in 614 minutes after meeting the omnibus Four answers have been received of which two are wrong DINAH MITE rightly states that the overtaking omnibus reached the point where they met the other omnibus 5 minutes after they left but wrongly concludes that going 5 times as fast it would overtake them in another minute The travellers are 5minuteswalk ahead of the omnibus and must walk 14th of this distance farther before the omnibus overtakes them which will be 15th of the distance traversed by the omnibus in the same time this will require 114 minutes more NOLENS VOLENS tries it by a process like Achilles and the Tortoise He rightly states that when the overtaking omnibus leaves the gate the travellers are 15th of _a_ ahead and that it will take the omnibus 3 minutes to traverse this distance during which time the travellers he tells us go 115th of _a_ this should be 125th The travellers being now 115th of _a_ ahead he concludes that the work remaining to be done is for the travellers to go 160th of _a_ while the omnibus goes 112th The _principle_ is correct and might have been applied earlier CLASS LIST I BALBUS DELTA ANSWERS TO KNOT IX 1 THE BUCKETS _Problem_Lardner states that a solid immersed in a fluid displaces an amount equal to itself in bulk How can this be true of a small bucket floating in a larger one _Solution_Lardner means by displaces occupies a space which might be filled with water without any change in the surroundings If the portion of the floating bucket which is above the water could be annihilated and the rest of it transformed into water the surrounding water would not change its position which agrees with Lardners statement Five answers have been received none of which explains the difficulty arising from the wellknown fact that a floating body is the same weight as the displaced fluid HECLA says that only that portion of the smaller bucket which descends below the original level of the water can be properly said to be immersed and only an equal bulk of water is displaced Hence according to HECLA a solid whose weight was equal to that of an equal bulk of water would not float till the whole of it was below the original level of the water but as a matter of fact it would float as soon as it was all under water MAGPIE says the fallacy is the assumption that one body can displace another from a place where it isnt and that Lardners assertion is incorrect except when the containing vessel was originally full to the brim But the question of floating depends on the present state of things not on past history OLD KING COLE takes the same view as HECLA TYMPANUM and VINDEX assume that displaced means raised above its original level and merely explain how it comes to pass that the water so raised is less in bulk than the immersed portion of bucket and thus land themselvesor rather set themselves floatingin the same boat as HECLA I regret that there is no Classlist to publish for this Problem 2 BALBUS ESSAY _Problem_Balbus states that if a certain solid be immersed in a certain vessel of water the water will rise through a series of distances two inches one inch half an inch c which series has no end He concludes that the water will rise without limit Is this true _Solution_No This series can never reach 4 inches since however many terms we take we are always short of 4 inches by an amount equal to the last term taken Three answers have been receivedbut only two seem to me worthy of honours TYMPANUM says that the statement about the stick is merely a blind to which the old answer may well be applied _solvitur ambulando_ or rather _mergendo_ I trust TYMPANUM will not test this in his own person by taking the place of the man in Balbus Essay He would infallibly be drowned OLD KING COLE rightly points out that the series 2 1 c is a decreasing Geometrical Progression while VINDEX rightly identifies the fallacy as that of Achilles and the Tortoise CLASS LIST I OLD KING COLE VINDEX 3 THE GARDEN _Problem_An oblong garden half a yard longer than wide consists entirely of a gravelwalk spirally arranged a yard wide and 3630 yards long Find the dimensions of the garden _Answer_60 6012 _Solution_The number of yards and fractions of a yard traversed in walking along a straight piece of walk is evidently the same as the number of squareyards and fractions of a squareyard contained in that piece of walk and the distance traversed in passing through a squareyard at a corner is evidently a yard Hence the area of the garden is 3630 squareyards _ie_ if _x_ be the width _x_ _x_ 12 3630 Solving this Quadratic we find _x_ 60 Hence the dimensions are 60 6012 Twelve answers have been receivedseven right and five wrong C G L NABOB OLD CROW and TYMPANUM assume that the number of yards in the length of the path is equal to the number of squareyards in the garden This is true but should have been proved But each is guilty of darker deeds C G Ls working consists of dividing 3630 by 60 Whence came this divisor oh Segiel Divination Or was it a dream I fear this solution is worth nothing OLD CROWS is shorter and so if possible worth rather less He says the answer is at once seen to be 60 6012 NABOBS calculation is short but as rich as a Nabob in error He says that the square root of 3630 multiplied by 2 equals the length plus the breadth That is 6025 2 12012 His first assertion is only true of a _square_ garden His second is irrelevant since 6025 is _not_ the squareroot of 3630 Nay Bob this will _not_ do TYMPANUM says that by extracting the squareroot of 3630 we get 60 yards with a remainder of 3060 or halfayard which we add so as to make the oblong 60 6012 This is very terrible but worse remains behind TYMPANUM proceeds thusBut why should there be the halfyard at all Because without it there would be no space at all for flowers By means of it we find reserved in the very centre a small plot of ground two yards long by halfayard wide the only space not occupied by walk But Balbus expressly said that the walk used up the whole of the area Oh TYMPANUM My tympa is exhausted my brain is num I can say no more HECLA indulges again and again in that most fatal of all habits in computationthe making _two_ mistakes which cancel each other She takes _x_ as the width of the garden in yards and _x_ 12 as its length and makes her first coil the sum of _x_12 _x_12 _x_1 _x_1 _ie_ 4_x_3 but the fourth term should be _x_112 so that her first coil is 12 a yard too long Her second coil is the sum of _x_212 _x_212 _x_3 _x_3 here the first term should be _x_2 and the last _x_312 these two mistakes cancel and this coil is therefore right And the same thing is true of every other coil but the last which needs an extra halfyard to reach the _end_ of the path and this exactly balances the mistake in the first coil Thus the sum total of the coils comes right though the working is all wrong Of the seven who are right DINAH MITE JANET MAGPIE and TAFFY make the same assumption as C G L and Co They then solve by a Quadratic MAGPIE also tries it by Arithmetical Progression but fails to notice that the first and last coils have special values ALUMNUS ETONÆ attempts to prove what C G L assumes by a particular instance taking a garden 6 by 512 He ought to have proved it generally what is true of one number is not always true of others OLD KING COLE solves it by an Arithmetical Progression It is right but too lengthy to be worth as much as a Quadratic VINDEX proves it very neatly by pointing out that a yard of walk measured along the middle represents a square yard of garden whether we consider the straight stretches of walk or the square yards at the angles in which the middle line goes half a yard in one direction and then turns a right angle and goes half a yard in another direction CLASS LIST I VINDEX II ALUMNUS ETONÆ OLD KING COLE III DINAH MITE JANET MAGPIE TAFFY ANSWERS TO KNOT X 1 THE CHELSEA PENSIONERS _Problem_If 70 per cent have lost an eye 75 per cent an ear 80 per cent an arm 85 per cent a leg what percentage _at least_ must have lost all four _Answer_Ten _Solution_I adopt that of POLAR STAR as being better than my own Adding the wounds together we get 70 75 80 85 310 among 100 men which gives 3 to each and 4 to 10 men Therefore the least percentage is 10 Nineteen answers have been received One is 5 but as no working is given with it it must in accordance with the rule remain a deed without a name JANET makes it 35 and 710ths I am sorry she has misunderstood the question and has supposed that those who had lost an ear were 75 per cent _of those who had lost an eye_ and so on Of course on this supposition the percentages must all be multiplied together This she has done correctly but I can give her no honours as I do not think the question will fairly bear her interpretation THREE SCORE AND TEN makes it 19 and 38ths Her solution has given meI will not say many anxious days and sleepless nights for I wish to be strictly truthful butsome trouble in making any sense at all of it She makes the number of pensioners wounded once to be 310 per cent I suppose dividing by 4 she gets 77 and a half as average percentage again dividing by 4 she gets 19 and 38ths as percentage wounded four times Does she suppose wounds of different kinds to absorb each other so to speak Then no doubt the _data_ are equivalent to 77 pensioners with one wound each and a halfpensioner with a halfwound And does she then suppose these concentrated wounds to be _transferable_ so that 34ths of these unfortunates can obtain perfect health by handing over their wounds to the remaining 14th Granting these suppositions her answer is right or rather _if_ the question had been A road is covered with one inch of gravel along 77 and a half per cent of it How much of it could be covered 4 inches deep with the same material her answer _would_ have been right But alas that _wasnt_ the question DELTA makes some most amazing assumptions let every one who has not lost an eye have lost an ear let every one who has not lost both eyes and ears have lost an arm Her ideas of a battlefield are grim indeed Fancy a warrior who would continue fighting after losing both eyes both ears and both arms This is a case which she or it evidently considers _possible_ Next come eight writers who have made the unwarrantable assumption that because 70 per cent have lost an eye _therefore_ 30 per cent have _not_ lost one so that they have _both_ eyes This is illogical If you give me a bag containing 100 sovereigns and if in an hour I come to you my face _not_ beaming with gratitude nearly so much as when I received the bag to say I am sorry to tell you that 70 of these sovereigns are bad do I thereby guarantee the other 30 to be good Perhaps I have not tested them yet The sides of this illogical octagon are as follows in alphabetical orderALGERNON BRAY DINAH MITE G S C JANE E J D W MAGPIE who makes the delightful remark therefore 90 per cent have two of something recalling to ones memory that fortunate monarch with whom Xerxes was so much pleased that he gave him ten of everything S S G and TOKIO BRADSHAW OF THE FUTURE and T R do the question in a piecemeal fashionon the principle that the 70 per cent and the 75 per cent though commenced at opposite ends of the 100 must overlap by _at least_ 45 per cent and so on This is quite correct working but not I think quite the best way of doing it The other five competitors will I

the statistics I am hoping for and partly because I am myself so entirely puzzled by it and when an examiner is himself dimly hovering between a second class and a third how is he to decide the position of others 3 THE SONS AGES _Problem_At first two of the ages are together equal to the third A few years afterwards two of them are together double of the third When the number of years since the first occasion is twothirds of the sum of the ages on that occasion one age is 21 What are the other two _Answer_15 and 18 _Solution_Let the ages at first be _x_ _y_ _x_ _y_ Now if _a_ _b_ 2_c_ then _a__n_ _b__n_ 2_c__n_ whatever be the value of _n_ Hence the second relationship if _ever_ true was _always_ true Hence it was true at first But it cannot be true that _x_ and _y_ are together double of _x_ _y_ Hence it must be true of _x_ _y_ together with _x_ or _y_ and it does not matter which we take We assume then _x_ _y_ _x_ 2_y_ _ie_ _y_ 2_x_ Hence the three ages were at first _x_ 2_x_ 3_x_ and the number of years since that time is twothirds of 6_x_ _ie_ is 4_x_ Hence the present ages are 5_x_ 6_x_ 7_x_ The ages are clearly _integers_ since this is only the year when one of my sons comes of age Hence 7_x_ 21 _x_ 3 and the other ages are 15 18 Eighteen answers have been received One of the writers merely asserts that the first occasion was 12 years ago that the ages were then 9 6 and 3 and that on the second occasion they were 14 11 and 8 As a Roman father I _ought_ to withhold the name of the rash writer but respect for age makes me break the rule it is THREE SCORE AND TEN JANE E also asserts that the ages at first were 9 6 3 then she calculates the present ages leaving the _second_ occasion unnoticed OLD HEN is nearly as bad she tried various numbers till I found one that fitted _all_ the conditions but merely scratching up the earth and pecking about is _not_ the way to solve a problem oh venerable bird And close after OLD HEN prowls with hungry eyes OLD CAT who calmly assumes to begin with that the son who comes of age is the _eldest_ Eat your bird Puss for you will get nothing from me There are yet two zeroes to dispose of MINERVA assumes that on _every_ occasion a son comes of age and that it is only such a son who is tipped with gold Is it wise thus to interpret now my boys calculate your ages and you shall have the money BRADSHAW OF THE FUTURE says let the ages at first be 9 6 3 then assumes that the second occasion was 6 years afterwards and on these baseless assumptions brings out the right answers Guide _future_ travellers an thou wilt thou art no Bradshaw for _this_ Age Of those who win honours the merely honourable are two DINAH MITE ascertains rightly the relationship between the three ages at first but then _assumes_ one of them to be 6 thus making the rest of her solution tentative M F C does the algebra all right up to the conclusion that the present ages are 5_z_ 6_z_ and 7_z_ it then assumes without giving any reason that 7_z_ 21 Of the more honourable DELTA attempts a noveltyto discover _which_ son comes of age by elimination it assumes successively that it is the middle one and that it is the youngest and in each case it _apparently_ brings out an absurdity Still as the proof contains the following bit of algebra 63 7_x_ 4_y_ therefore 21 _x_ 4 sevenths of _y_ I trust it will admit that its proof is not _quite_ conclusive The rest of its work is good MAGPIE betrays the deplorable tendency of her tribeto appropriate any stray conclusion she comes across without having any _strict_ logical right to it Assuming _A_ _B_ _C_ as the ages at first and _D_ as the number of the years that have elapsed since then she finds rightly the 3 equations 2_A_ _B_ _C_ _B_ _A_ _D_ 2_B_ She then says supposing that _A_ 1 then _B_ 2 _C_ 3 and _D_ 4 Therefore for _A_ _B_ _C_ _D_ four numbers are wanted which shall be to each other as 1234 It is in the therefore that I detect the unconscientiousness of this bird The conclusion _is_ true but this is only because the equations are homogeneous _ie_ having one unknown in each term a fact which I strongly suspect had not been graspedI beg pardon clawedby her Were I to lay this little pitfall _A_ 1 _B_ _B_ 1 _C_ supposing _A_ 1 then _B_ 2 and _C_ 3 _Therefore_ for _A_ _B_ _C_ three numbers are wanted which shall be to one another as 123 would you not flutter down into it oh MAGPIE as amiably as a Dove SIMPLE SUSAN is anything but simple to _me_ After ascertaining that the 3 ages at first are as 321 she says then as twothirds of their sum added to one of them 21 the sum cannot exceed 30 and consequently the highest cannot exceed 15 I suppose her mental argument is something like thistwothirds of sum one age 21 therefore sum 3 halves of one age 31 and a half But 3 halves of one age cannot be less than 1 andahalf here I perceive that SIMPLE SUSAN would on no account present a guinea to a newborn baby hence the sum cannot exceed 30 This is ingenious but her proof after that is as she candidly admits clumsy and roundabout She finds that there are 5 possible sets of ages and eliminates four of them Suppose that instead of 5 there had been 5 million possible sets Would SIMPLE SUSAN have courageously ordered in the necessary gallon of ink and ream of paper The solution sent in by C R is like that of SIMPLE SUSAN partly tentative and so does not rise higher than being Clumsily Right Among those who have earned the highest honours ALGERNON BRAY solves the problem quite correctly but adds that there is nothing to exclude the supposition that all the ages were _fractional_ This would make the number of answers infinite Let me meekly protest that I _never_ intended my readers to devote the rest of their lives to writing out answers E M RIX points out that if fractional ages be admissible any one of the three sons might be the one come of age but she rightly rejects this supposition on the ground that it would make the problem indeterminate WHITE SUGAR is the only one who has detected an oversight of mine I had forgotten the possibility which of course ought to be allowed for that the son who came of age that _year_ need not have done so by that _day_ so that he _might_ be only 20 This gives a second solution viz 20 24 28 Well said pure Crystal Verily thy fair discourse hath been as sugar CLASS LIST I ALGERNON BRAY AN

that it was illogical to assume from the _datum_ 70 p c have lost an eye that 30 p c have _not_ ALGERNON BRAY states as a parallel case suppose Tommys father gives him 4 apples and he eats one of them how many has he left and says I think we are justified in answering 3 I think so too There is no must here and the _data_ are evidently meant to fix the answer _exactly_ but if the question were set me how many _must_ he have left I should understand the _data_ to be that his father gave him 4 _at least_ but _may_ have given him more I take this opportunity of thanking those who have sent along with their answers to the Tenth Knot regrets that there are no more Knots to come or petitions that I should recall my resolution to bring them to an end I am most grateful for their kind words but I think it wisest to end what at best was but a lame attempt The stretched metre of an antique song is beyond my compass and my puppets were neither distinctly _in_ my life like those I now address nor yet like Alice and the Mock Turtle distinctly _out_ of it Yet let me at least fancy as I lay down the pen that I carry with me into my silent life dear reader a farewell smile from your unseen face

thing was certain that the _white_ kitten had had nothing to do with itit was the black kittens fault entirely For the white kitten had been having its face washed by the old cat for the last quarter of an hour and bearing it pretty well considering so you see that it _couldnt_ have had any hand in the mischief The way Dinah washed her childrens faces was this first she held the poor thing down by its ear with one paw and then with the other paw she rubbed its face all over the wrong way beginning at the nose and just now as I said she was hard at work on the white kitten which was lying quite still and trying to purrno doubt feeling that it was all meant for its good But the black kitten had been finished with earlier in the afternoon and so while Alice was sitting curled up in a corner of the great armchair half talking to herself and half asleep the kitten had been having a grand game of romps with the ball of worsted Alice had been trying to wind up and had been rolling it up and down till it had all come undone again and there it was spread over the hearthrug all knots and tangles with the kitten running after its own tail in the middle Oh you wicked little thing cried Alice catching up the kitten and giving it a little kiss to make it understand that it was in disgrace Really Dinah ought to have taught you better manners You _ought_ Dinah you know you ought she added looking reproachfully at the old cat and speaking in as cross a voice as she could manageand then she scrambled back into the armchair taking the kitten and the worsted with her and began winding up the ball again But she didnt get on very fast as she was talking all the time sometimes to the kitten and sometimes to herself Kitty sat very demurely on her knee pretending to watch the progress of the winding and now and then putting out one paw and gently touching the ball as if it would be glad to help if it might Do you know what tomorrow is Kitty Alice began Youd have guessed if youd been up in the window with meonly Dinah was making you tidy so you couldnt I was watching the boys getting in sticks for the bonfireand it wants plenty of sticks Kitty Only it got so cold and it snowed so they had to leave off Never mind Kitty well go and see the bonfire tomorrow Here Alice wound two or three turns of the worsted round the kittens neck just to see how it would look this led to a scramble in which the ball rolled down upon the floor and yards and yards of it got unwound again Do you know I was so angry Kitty Alice went on as soon as they were comfortably settled again when I saw all the mischief you had been doing I was very nearly opening the window and putting you out into the snow And youd have deserved it you little mischievous darling What have you got to say for yourself Now dont interrupt me she went on holding up one finger Im going to tell you all your faults Number one you squeaked twice while Dinah was washing your face this morning Now you cant deny it Kitty I heard you Whats that you say pretending that the kitten was speaking Her paw went into your eye Well thats _your_ fault for keeping your eyes openif youd shut them tight up it wouldnt have happened Now dont make any more excuses but listen Number two you pulled Snowdrop away by the tail just as I had put down the saucer of milk before her What you were thirsty were you How do you know she wasnt thirsty too Now for number three you unwound every bit of the worsted while I wasnt looking Thats three faults Kitty and youve not been punished for any of them yet You know Im saving up all your punishments for Wednesday weekSuppose they had saved up all _my_ punishments she went on talking more to herself than the kitten What _would_ they do at the end of a year I should be sent to prison I suppose when the day came Orlet me seesuppose each punishment was to be going without a dinner then when the miserable day came I should have to go without fifty dinners at once Well I shouldnt mind _that_ much Id far rather go without them than eat them Do you hear the snow against the windowpanes Kitty How nice and soft it sounds Just as if some one was kissing the window all over outside I wonder if the snow _loves_ the trees and fields that it kisses them so gently And then it covers them up snug you know with a white quilt and perhaps it says Go to sleep darlings till the summer comes again And when they wake up in the summer Kitty they dress themselves all in green and dance aboutwhenever the wind blowsoh thats very pretty cried Alice dropping the ball of worsted to clap her hands And I do so _wish_ it was true Im sure the woods look sleepy in the autumn when the leaves are getting brown Kitty can you play chess Now dont smile my dear Im asking it seriously Because when we were playing just now you watched just as if you understood it and when I said Check you purred Well it _was_ a nice check Kitty and really I might have won if it hadnt been for that nasty Knight that came wiggling down among my pieces Kitty dear lets pretend And here I wish I could tell you half the things Alice used to say beginning with her favourite phrase Lets pretend She had had quite a long argument with her sister only the day beforeall because Alice had begun with Lets pretend were kings and queens and her sister who liked being very exact had argued that they couldnt because there were only two of them and Alice had been reduced at last to say Well _you_ can be one of them then and _Ill_ be all the rest And once she had really frightened her old nurse by shouting suddenly in her ear Nurse Do lets pretend that Im a hungry hyaena and youre a bone But this is taking us away from Alices speech to the kitten Lets pretend that youre the Red Queen Kitty Do you know I think if you sat up and folded your arms youd look exactly like her Now do try theres a dear And Alice got the Red Queen off the table and set it up before the kitten as a model for it to imitate however the thing didnt succeed principally Alice said because the kitten wouldnt fold its arms properly So to punish it she held it up to the Lookingglass that it might see how sulky it wasand if youre not good directly she added Ill put you through into Lookingglass House How would you like _that_ Now if youll only attend Kitty and not talk so much Ill tell you all my ideas about Lookingglass House First theres the room you can see through the glassthats just the same as our drawing room only the things go the other way I can see all of it when I get upon a chairall but the bit behind the fireplace Oh I do so wish I could see _that_ bit I want so much to know whether theyve a fire in the winter you never _can_ tell you know unless our fire smokes and then smoke comes up in that room toobut that may be only pretence just to make it look as if they had a fire Well then the books are something like our books only the words go the wrong way I know that because Ive held up one of our books to the glass and then they hold up one in the other room How would you like to live in Lookingglass House Kitty I wonder if theyd give you milk in there Perhaps Lookingglass milk isnt good to drinkBut oh Kitty now we come to the passage You can just see a little _peep_ of the passage in Lookingglass House if you leave the door of our drawingroom wide open and its very like our passage as far as you can see only you know it may be quite different on beyond Oh Kitty how nice it would be if we could only get through into Lookingglass House Im sure its got oh such beautiful things in it Lets pretend theres a way of getting through into it somehow Kitty Lets pretend the glass has got all soft like gauze so that we can get through Why its turning into a sort of mist now I declare Itll be easy enough to get through She was up on the chimneypiece while she said this though she hardly knew how she had got there And certainly the glass _was_ beginning to melt away just like a bright silvery mist In another moment Alice was through the glass and had jumped lightly down into the Lookingglass room The very first thing she did was to look whether there was a fire in the fireplace and she was quite pleased to find that there was a real one blazing away as brightly as the one she had left behind So I shall be as warm here as I was in the old room thought Alice warmer in fact because therell be no one here to scold me away from the fire Oh what fun itll be when they see me through the glass in here and cant get at me Then she began looking about and noticed that what could be seen from the old room was quite common and uninteresting but that all the rest was as different as possible For instance the pictures on the wall next the fire seemed to be all alive and the very clock on the chimneypiece you know you can only see the back of it in the Lookingglass had got the face of a little old man and grinned at her They dont keep this room so tidy as the other Alice thought to herself as she noticed several of the chessmen down in the hearth among the cinders but in another moment with a little Oh of surprise she was down on her hands and knees watching them The chessmen were walking about two and two Here are the Red King and the Red Queen Alice said in a whisper for fear of frightening them and there are the White King and the White Queen sitting on the edge of the shoveland here are two castles walking arm in armI dont think they can hear me she went on as she put her head closer down and Im nearly sure they cant see me I feel somehow as if I were invisible Here something began squeaking on the table behind Alice and made her turn her head just in time to see one of the White Pawns roll over and begin kicking she watched it with great curiosity to see what would happen next It is the voice of my child the White Queen cried out as she rushed past the King so violently that she knocked him over among the cinders My precious Lily My imperial kitten and she began scrambling wildly up the side of the fender Imperial fiddlestick said the King rubbing his nose which had been hurt by the fall He had a right to be a _little_ annoyed with the Queen for he was covered with ashes from head to foot Alice was very anxious to be of use and as the poor little Lily was nearly screaming herself into a fit she hastily picked up the Queen and set her on the table by the side of her noisy little daughter The Queen gasped and sat down the rapid journey through the air had quite taken away her breath and for a minute or two she could do nothing but hug the little Lily in silence As soon as she had recovered her breath a little she called out to the White King who was sitting sulkily among the ashes Mind the volcano What volcano said the King looking up anxiously into the fire as if he thought that was the most likely place to find one Blewmeup panted the Queen who was still a little out of breath Mind you come upthe regular waydont get blown up Alice watched the White King as he slowly struggled up from bar to bar till at last she said Why youll be hours and hours getting to the table at that rate Id far better help you hadnt I But the King took no notice of the question it was quite clear that he could neither hear her nor see her So Alice picked him up very gently and lifted him across more slowly than she had lifted the Queen that she mightnt take his breath away but before she put him on the table she thought she might as well dust him a little he was so covered with ashes She said afterwards that she had never seen in all her life such a face as the King made when he found himself held in the air by an invisible hand and being dusted he was far too much astonished to cry out but his eyes and his mouth went on getting larger and larger and rounder and rounder till her hand shook so with laughing that she nearly let him drop upon the floor Oh _please_ dont make such faces my dear she cried out quite forgetting that the King couldnt hear her You make me laugh so that I can hardly hold you And dont keep your mouth so wide open All the ashes will get into itthere now I think youre tidy enough she added as she smoothed his hair and set him upon the table near the Queen The King immediately fell flat on his back and lay perfectly still and Alice was a little alarmed at what she had done and went round the room to see if she could find any water to throw over him However she could find nothing but a bottle of ink and when she got back with it she found he had recovered and he and the Queen were talking together in a frightened whisperso low that Alice could hardly hear what they said The King was saying I assure you my dear I turned cold to the very ends of my whiskers To which the Queen replied You havent got any whiskers The horror of that moment the King went on I shall never _never_ forget You will though the Queen said if you dont make a memorandum of it Alice looked on with great interest as the King took an enormous memorandumbook out of his pocket and began writing A sudden thought struck her and she took hold of the end of the pencil which came some way over his shoulder and began writing for him The poor King looked puzzled and unhappy and struggled with the pencil for some time without saying anything but Alice was too strong for him and at last he panted out My dear I really _must_ get a thinner pencil I cant manage this one a bit it writes all manner of things that I dont intend What manner of things said the Queen looking over the book in which Alice had put _The White Knight is sliding down the poker He balances very badly_ Thats not a memorandum of _your_ feelings There was a book lying near Alice on the table and while she sat watching the White King for she was still a little anxious about him and had the ink all ready to throw over him in case he fainted again she turned over the leaves to find some part that she could read for its all in some language I dont know she said to herself It was like this YKCOWREBBAJ sevot yhtils eht dna gillirb sawT ebaw eht ni elbmig dna eryg diD sevogorob eht erew ysmim llA ebargtuo shtar emom eht dnA She puzzled over this for some time but at last a bright thought struck her Why its a Lookingglass book of course And if I hold it up to a glass the words will all go the right way again This was the poem that Alice read JABBERWOCKY Twas brillig and the slithy toves Did gyre and gimble in the wabe All mimsy were the borogoves And the mome raths outgrabe Beware the Jabberwock my son The jaws that bite the claws that catch Beware the Jubjub bird and shun The frumious Bandersnatch He took his vorpal sword in hand Long time the manxome foe he sought So rested he by the Tumtum tree And stood awhile in thought And as in uffish thought he stood The Jabberwock with eyes of flame Came whiffling through the tulgey wood And burbled as it came One two One two And through and through The vorpal blade went snickersnack He left it dead and with its head He went galumphing back And hast thou slain the Jabberwock Come to my arms my beamish boy O frabjous day Callooh Callay He chortled in his joy Twas brillig and the slithy toves Did gyre and gimble in the wabe All mimsy were the borogoves And the mome raths outgrabe It seems very pretty she said when she had finished it but its _rather_ hard to understand You see she didnt like to confess even to herself that she couldnt make it out at all Somehow it seems to fill my head with ideasonly I dont exactly know what they are However _somebody_ killed _something_ thats clear at any rate But oh thought Alice suddenly jumping up if I dont make haste I shall have to go back through the Lookingglass before Ive seen what the rest of the house is like Lets have a look at the garden first She was out of the room in a moment and ran down stairsor at least it wasnt exactly running but a new invention of hers for getting down stairs quickly and easily as Alice said to herself She just kept the tips of her fingers on the handrail and floated gently down without even touching the stairs with her feet then she floated on through the hall and would have gone straight out at the door in the same way if she hadnt caught hold of the doorpost She was getting a little giddy with so much floating in the air and was rather glad to find herself walking again in the natural way CHAPTER II The Garden of Live Flowers I should see the garden far better said Alice to herself if I could get to the top of that hill and heres a path that leads straight to itat least no it doesnt do that after going a few yards along the path and turning several sharp corners but I suppose it will at last But how curiously it twists Its more like a corkscrew than a path Well _this_ turn goes to the hill I supposeno it doesnt This goes straight back to the house Well then Ill try it the other way And so she did wandering up and down and trying turn after turn but always coming back to the house do what she would Indeed once when she turned a corner rather more quickly than usual she ran against it before she could stop herself Its no use talking about it Alice said looking up at the house and pretending it was arguing with her Im _not_ going in again yet I know I should have to get through the Lookingglass againback into the old roomand thered be an end of all my adventures So resolutely turning her back upon the house she set out once more down the path determined to keep straight on till she got to the hill For a few minutes all went on well and she was just saying I really _shall_ do it this time when the path gave a sudden twist and shook itself as she described it afterwards and the next moment she found herself actually walking in at the door Oh its too bad she cried I never saw such a house for getting in the way Never However there was the hill full in sight so there was nothing to be done but start again This time she came upon a large flowerbed with a border of daisies and a willowtree growing in the middle O Tigerlily said Alice addressing herself to one that was waving gracefully about in the wind I _wish_ you could talk We _can_ talk said the Tigerlily when theres anybody worth talking to Alice was so astonished that she could not speak for a minute it quite seemed to take her breath away At length as the Tigerlily only went on waving about she spoke again in a timid voicealmost in a whisper And can _all_ the flowers talk As well as _you_ can said the Tigerlily And a great deal louder It isnt manners for us to begin you know said the Rose and I really was wondering when youd speak Said I to myself Her face has got _some_ sense in it though its not a clever one Still youre the right colour and that goes a long way I dont care about the colour the Tigerlily remarked If only her petals curled up a little more shed be all right Alice didnt like being criticised so she began asking questions Arent you sometimes frightened at being planted out here with nobody to take care of you Theres the tree in the middle said the Rose what else is it good for But what could it do if any danger came Alice asked It says Boughwough cried a Daisy thats why its branches are called boughs Didnt you know _that_ cried another Daisy and here they all began shouting together till the air seemed quite full of little shrill voices Silence every one of you cried the Tigerlily waving itself passionately from side to side and trembling with excitement They know I cant get at them it panted bending its quivering head towards Alice or they wouldnt dare to do it Never mind Alice said in a soothing tone and stooping down to the daisies who were just beginning again she whispered If you dont hold your tongues Ill pick you There was silence in a moment and several of the pink daisies turned white Thats right said the Tigerlily The daisies are worst of all When one speaks they all begin together and its enough to make one wither to hear the way they go on How is it you can all talk so nicely Alice said hoping to get it into a better temper by a compliment Ive been in many gardens before but none of the flowers could talk Put your hand down and feel the ground said the Tigerlily Then youll know why Alice did so Its very hard she said but I dont see what that has to do with it In most gardens the Tigerlily said they make the beds too softso that the flowers are always asleep This sounded a very good reason and Alice was quite pleased to know it I never thought of that before she said Its _my_ opinion that you never think _at all_ the Rose said in a rather severe tone I never saw anybody that looked stupider a Violet said so suddenly that Alice quite jumped for it hadnt spoken before Hold _your_ tongue cried the Tigerlily As if _you_ ever saw anybody You keep your head under the leaves and snore away there till you know no more whats going on in the world than if you were a bud Are there any more people in the garden besides me Alice said not choosing to notice the Roses last remark Theres one other flower in the garden that can move about like you said the Rose I wonder how you do it Youre always wondering said the Tigerlily but shes more bushy than you are Is she like me Alice asked eagerly for the thought crossed her mind Theres another little girl in the garden somewhere Well she has the same awkward shape as you the Rose said but shes redderand her petals are shorter I think Her petals are done up close almost like a dahlia the Tigerlily interrupted not tumbled about anyhow like yours But thats not _your_ fault the Rose added kindly youre beginning to fade you knowand then one cant help ones petals getting a little untidy Alice didnt like this idea at all so to change the subject she asked Does she ever come out here I daresay youll see her soon said the Rose Shes one of the thorny kind Where does she wear the thorns Alice asked with some curiosity Why all round her head of course the Rose replied I was wondering _you_ hadnt got some too I thought it was the regular rule Shes coming cried the Larkspur I hear her footstep thump thump thump along the gravelwalk Alice looked round eagerly and found that it was the Red Queen Shes grown a good deal was her first remark She had indeed when Alice first found her in the ashes she had been only three inches highand here she was half a head taller than Alice herself Its the fresh air that does it said the Rose wonderfully fine air it is out here I think Ill go and meet her said Alice for though the flowers were interesting enough she felt that it would be far grander to have a talk with a real Queen You cant possibly do that said the Rose _I_ should advise you to walk the other way This sounded nonsense to Alice so she said nothing but set off at once towards the Red Queen To her surprise she lost sight of her in a moment and found herself walking in at the frontdoor again A little provoked she drew back and after looking everywhere for the queen whom she spied out at last a long way off she thought she would try the plan this time of walking in the opposite direction It succeeded beautifully She had not been walking a minute before she found herself face to face with the Red Queen and full in sight of the hill she had been so long aiming at Where do you come from said the Red Queen And where are you going Look up speak nicely and dont twiddle your fingers all the time Alice attended to all these directions and explained as well as she could that she had lost her way I dont know what you mean by _your_ way said the Queen all the ways about here belong to _me_but why did you come out here at all she added in a kinder tone Curtsey while youre thinking what to say it saves time Alice wondered a little at this but she was too much in awe of the Queen to disbelieve it Ill try it when I go home she thought to herself the next time Im a little late for dinner Its time for you to answer now the Queen said looking at her watch open your mouth a _little_ wider when you speak and always say your Majesty I only wanted to see what the garden was like your Majesty Thats right said the Queen patting her on the head which Alice didnt like at all though when you say garden_Ive_ seen gardens compared with which this would be a wilderness Alice didnt dare to argue the point but went on and I thought Id try and find my way to the top of that hill When you say hill the Queen interrupted _I_ could show you hills in comparison with which youd call that a valley No I shouldnt said Alice surprised into contradicting her at last a hill _cant_ be a valley you know That would be nonsense The Red Queen shook her head You may call it nonsense if you like she said but _Ive_ heard nonsense compared with which that would be as sensible as a dictionary Alice curtseyed again as she was afraid from the Queens tone that she was a _little_ offended and they walked on in silence till they got to the top of the little hill For some minutes Alice stood without speaking looking out in all directions over the countryand a most curious country it was There were a number of tiny little brooks running straight across it from side to side and the ground between was divided up into squares by a number of little green hedges that reached from brook to brook I declare its marked out just like a large chessboard Alice said at last There ought to be some men moving about somewhereand so there are She added in a tone of delight and her heart began to beat quick with excitement as she went on Its a great huge game of chess thats being playedall over the worldif this _is_ the world at all you know Oh what fun it is How I _wish_ I was one of them I wouldnt mind being a Pawn if only I might jointhough of course I should _like_ to be a Queen best She glanced rather shyly at the real Queen as she said this but her companion only smiled pleasantly and said Thats easily managed You can be the White Queens Pawn if you like as Lilys too young to play and youre in the Second Square to begin with when you get to the Eighth Square youll be a Queen Just at this moment somehow or other they began to run Alice never could quite make out in thinking it over afterwards how it was that they began all she remembers is that they were running hand in hand and the Queen went so fast that it was all she could do to keep up with her and still the Queen kept crying Faster Faster but Alice felt she _could not_ go faster though she had not breath left to say so The most curious part of the thing was that the trees and the other things round them never changed their places at all however fast they went they never seemed to pass anything I wonder if all the things move along with us thought poor puzzled Alice And the Queen seemed to guess her thoughts for she cried Faster Dont try to talk Not that Alice had any idea of doing _that_ She felt as if she would never be able to talk again she was getting so much out of breath and still the Queen cried Faster Faster and dragged her along Are we nearly there Alice managed to pant out at last Nearly there the Queen repeated Why we passed it ten minutes ago Faster And they ran on for a time in silence with the wind whistling in Alices ears and almost blowing her hair off her head she fancied Now Now cried the Queen Faster Faster And they went so fast that at last they seemed to skim through the air hardly touching the ground with their feet till suddenly just as Alice was getting quite exhausted they stopped and she found herself sitting on the ground breathless and giddy The Queen propped her up against a tree and said kindly You may rest a little now Alice looked round her in great surprise Why I do believe weve been under this tree the whole time Everythings just as it was Of course it is said the Queen what would you have it Well in _our_ country said Alice still panting a little youd generally get to somewhere elseif you ran very fast for a long time as weve been doing A slow sort of country said the Queen Now _here_ you see it takes all the running _you_ can do to keep in the same place If you want to get somewhere else you must run at least twice as fast as that Id rather not try please said Alice Im quite content to stay hereonly I _am_ so hot and thirsty I know what _youd_ like the Queen said goodnaturedly taking a little box out of her pocket Have a biscuit Alice thought it would not be civil to say No though it wasnt at all what she wanted So she took it and ate it as well as she could and it was _very_ dry and she thought she had never been so nearly choked in all her life While youre refreshing yourself said the Queen Ill just take the measurements And she took a ribbon out of her pocket marked in inches and began measuring the ground and sticking little pegs in here and there At the end of two yards she said putting in a peg to mark the distance I shall give you your directionshave another biscuit No thank you said Alice ones _quite_ enough Thirst quenched I hope said the Queen Alice did not know what to say to this but luckily the Queen did not wait for an answer but went on At the end of _three_ yards I shall repeat themfor fear of your forgetting them At the end of _four_ I shall say goodbye And at the end of _five_ I shall go She had got all the pegs put in by this time and Alice looked on with great interest as she returned to the tree and then began slowly walking down the row At the twoyard peg she faced round and said A pawn goes two squares in its first move you know So youll go _very_ quickly through the Third Squareby railway I should thinkand youll find yourself in the Fourth Square in no time Well _that_ square belongs to Tweedledum and Tweedledeethe Fifth is mostly waterthe Sixth belongs to Humpty DumptyBut you make no remark II didnt know I had to make onejust then Alice faltered out You _should_ have said Its extremely kind of you to tell me all thishowever well suppose it saidthe Seventh Square is all foresthowever one of the Knights will show you the wayand in the Eighth Square we shall be Queens together and its all feasting and fun Alice got up and curtseyed and sat down again At the next peg the Queen turned again and this time she said Speak in French when you cant think of the English for a thingturn out your toes as you walkand remember who you are She did not wait for Alice to curtsey this time but walked on quickly to the next peg where she turned for a moment to say goodbye and then hurried on to the last How it happened Alice never knew but exactly as she came to the last peg she was gone Whether she vanished into the air or whether she ran quickly into the wood and she _can_ run very fast thought Alice there was no way of guessing but she was gone and Alice began to remember that she was a Pawn and that it would soon be time for her to move CHAPTER III LookingGlass Insects Of course the first thing to do was to make a grand survey of the country she was going to travel through Its something very like learning geography thought Alice as she stood on tiptoe in hopes of being able to see a little further Principal riversthere _are_ none Principal mountainsIm on the only one but I dont think its got any name Principal townswhy what _are_ those creatures making honey down there They cant be beesnobody ever saw bees a mile off you know and for some time she stood silent watching one of them that was bustling about among the flowers poking its proboscis into them just as if it was a regular bee thought Alice However this was anything but a regular bee in fact it was an elephantas Alice soon found out though the idea quite took her breath away at first And what enormous flowers they must be was her next idea Something like cottages with the roofs taken off and stalks put to themand what quantities of honey they must make I think Ill go down andno I wont _just_ yet she went on checking herself just as she was beginning to run down the hill and trying to find some excuse for turning shy so suddenly Itll never do to go down among them without a good long branch to brush them awayand what fun itll be when they ask me how I like my walk I shall sayOh I like it well enough here came the favourite little toss of the head only it was so dusty and hot and the elephants did tease so I think Ill go down the other way she said after a pause and perhaps I may visit the elephants later on Besides I do so want to get into the Third Square So with this excuse she ran down the hill and jumped over the first of the six little brooks Tickets please said the Guard putting his head in at the window In a moment everybody was holding out a ticket they were about the same size as the people and quite seemed to fill the carriage Now then Show your ticket child the Guard went on looking angrily at Alice And a great many voices all said together like the chorus of a song thought Alice Dont keep him waiting child Why his time is worth a thousand pounds a minute Im afraid I havent got one Alice said in a frightened tone there wasnt a ticketoffice where I came from And again the chorus of voices went on There wasnt room for one where she came from The land there is worth a thousand pounds an inch Dont make excuses said the Guard you should have bought one from the enginedriver And once more the chorus of voices went on with The man that drives the engine Why the smoke alone is worth a thousand pounds a puff Alice thought to herself Then theres no use in speaking The voices didnt join in this time as she hadnt spoken but to her great surprise they all _thought_ in chorus I hope you understand what _thinking in chorus_ meansfor I must confess that _I_ dont Better say nothing at all Language is worth a thousand pounds a word I shall dream about a thousand pounds tonight I know I shall thought Alice All this time the Guard was looking at her first through a telescope then through a microscope and then through an operaglass At last he said Youre travelling the wrong way and shut up the window and went away So young a child said the gentleman sitting opposite to her he was dressed in white paper ought to know which way shes going even if she doesnt know her own name A Goat that was sitting next to the gentleman in white shut his eyes and said in a loud voice She ought to know her way to the ticketoffice even if she doesnt know her alphabet There was a Beetle sitting next to the Goat it was a very queer carriagefull of passengers altogether and as the rule seemed to be that they should all speak in turn _he_ went on with Shell have to go back from here as luggage Alice couldnt see who was sitting beyond the Beetle but a hoarse voice spoke next Change engines it said and was obliged to leave off It sounds like a horse Alice thought to herself And an extremely small voice close to her ear said You might make a joke on thatsomething about horse and hoarse you know Then a very gentle voice in the distance said She must be labelled Lass with care you know And after that other voices went on What a number of people there are in the carriage thought Alice saying She must go by post as shes got a head on her She must be sent as a message by the telegraph She must draw the train herself the rest of the way and so on But the gentleman dressed in white paper leaned forwards and whispered in her ear Never mind what they all say my dear but take a returnticket every time the train stops Indeed I shant Alice said rather impatiently I dont belong to this railway journey at allI was in a wood just nowand I wish I could get back there You might make a joke on _that_ said the little voice close to her ear something about you _would_ if you could you know Dont tease so said Alice looking about in vain to see where the voice came from if youre so anxious to have a joke made why dont you make one yourself The little voice sighed deeply it was _very_ unhappy evidently and Alice would have said something pitying to comfort it If it would only sigh like other people she thought But this was such a wonderfully small sigh that she wouldnt have heard it at all if it hadnt come _quite_ close to her ear The consequence of this was that it tickled her ear very much and quite took off her thoughts from the unhappiness of the poor little creature I know you are a friend the little voice went on a dear friend and an old friend And you wont hurt me though I _am_ an insect What kind of insect Alice inquired a little anxiously What she really wanted to know was whether it could sting or not but she thought this wouldnt be quite a civil question to ask What then you dont the little voice began when it was drowned by a shrill scream from the engine and everybody jumped up in alarm Alice among the rest The Horse who had put his head out of the window quietly drew it in and said Its only a brook we have to jump over Everybody seemed satisfied with this though Alice felt a little nervous at the idea of trains jumping at all However itll take us into the Fourth Square thats some comfort she said to herself In another moment she felt the carriage rise straight up into the air and in her fright she caught at the thing nearest to her hand which happened to be the Goats beard But the beard seemed to melt away as she touched it and she found herself sitting quietly under a treewhile the Gnat for that was the insect she had been talking to was balancing itself on a twig just over her head and fanning her with its wings It certainly was a _very_ large Gnat about the size of a chicken Alice thought Still she couldnt feel nervous with it after they had been talking together so long then you dont like all insects the Gnat went on as quietly as if nothing had happened I like them when they can talk Alice said None of them ever talk where _I_ come from What sort of insects do you rejoice in where _you_ come from the Gnat inquired I dont _rejoice_ in insects at all Alice explained because Im rather afraid of themat least the large kinds But I can tell you the names of some of them Of course they answer to their names the Gnat remarked carelessly I never knew them to do it Whats the use of their having names the Gnat said if they wont answer to them No use to _them_ said Alice but its useful to the people who name them I suppose If not why do things have names at all I cant say the Gnat replied Further on in the wood down there theyve got no nameshowever go on with your list of insects youre wasting time Well theres the Horsefly Alice began counting off the names on her fingers All right said the Gnat half way up that bush youll see a Rockinghorsefly if you look Its made entirely of wood and gets about by swinging itself from branch to branch What does it live on Alice asked with great curiosity Sap and sawdust said the Gnat Go on with the list Alice looked up at the Rockinghorsefly with great interest and made up her mind that it must have been just repainted it looked so bright and sticky and then she went on And theres the Dragonfly Look on the branch above your head said the Gnat and there youll find a snapdragonfly Its body is made of plumpudding its wings of hollyleaves and its head is a raisin burning in brandy And what does it live on Frumenty and mince pie the Gnat replied and it makes its nest in a Christmas box And then theres the Butterfly Alice went on after she had taken a good look at the insect with its head on fire and had thought to herself I wonder if thats the reason insects are so fond of flying into candlesbecause they want to turn into Snapdragonflies Crawling at your feet said the Gnat Alice drew her feet back in some alarm you may observe a BreadandButterfly Its wings are thin slices of Breadandbutter its body is a crust and its head is a lump of sugar And what does _it_ live on Weak tea with cream in it A new difficulty came into Alices head Supposing it couldnt find any she suggested Then it would die of course But that must happen very often Alice remarked thoughtfully It always happens said the Gnat After this Alice was silent for a minute or two pondering The Gnat amused itself meanwhile by humming round and round her head at last it settled again and remarked I suppose you dont want to lose your name No indeed Alice said a little anxiously And yet I dont know the Gnat went on in a careless tone only think how convenient it would be if you could manage to go home without it For instance if the governess wanted to call you to your lessons she would call out come here and there she would have to leave off because there wouldnt be any name for her to call and of course you wouldnt have to go you know That would never do Im sure said Alice the governess would never think of excusing me lessons for that If she couldnt remember my name shed call me Miss as the servants do Well if she said Miss and didnt say anything more the Gnat remarked of course youd miss your lessons Thats a joke I wish _you_ had made it Why do you wish _I_ had made it Alice asked Its a very bad one But the Gnat only sighed deeply while two large tears came rolling down its cheeks You shouldnt make jokes Alice said if it makes you so unhappy Then came another of those melancholy little sighs and this time the poor Gnat really seemed to have sighed itself away for when Alice looked up there was nothing whatever to be seen on the twig and as she was getting quite chilly with sitting still so long she got up and walked on She very soon came to an open field with a wood on the other side of it it looked much darker than the last wood and Alice felt a _little_ timid about going into it However on second thoughts she made up her mind to go on for I certainly wont go _back_ she thought to herself and this was the only way to the Eighth Square This must be the wood she said thoughtfully to herself where things have no names I wonder whatll become of _my_ name when I go in I shouldnt like to lose it at allbecause theyd have to give me another and it would be almost certain to be an ugly one But then the fun would be trying to find the creature that had got my old name Thats just like the advertisements you know when people lose dogs_answers to the name of Dash had on a brass collar_just fancy calling everything you met Alice till one of them answered Only they wouldnt answer at all if they were wise She was rambling on in this way when she reached the wood it looked very cool and shady Well at any rate its a great comfort she said as she stepped under the trees after being so hot to get into theinto _what_ she went on rather surprised at not being able to think of the word I mean to get under theunder theunder _this_ you know putting her hand on the trunk of the tree What _does_ it call itself I wonder I do believe its got no namewhy to be sure it hasnt She stood silent for a minute thinking then she suddenly began again Then it really _has_ happened after all And now who am I I _will_ remember if I can Im determined to do it But being determined didnt help much and all she could say after a great deal of puzzling was L I _know_ it begins with L Just then a Fawn came wandering by it looked at Alice with its large gentle eyes but didnt seem at all frightened Here then Here then Alice said as she held out her hand and tried to stroke it but it only started back a little and then stood looking at her again What do you call yourself the Fawn said at last Such a soft sweet voice it had I wish I knew thought poor Alice She answered rather sadly Nothing just now Think again it said that wont do Alice thought but nothing came of it Please would you tell me what _you_ call yourself she said timidly I think that might help a little Ill tell you if youll move a little further on the Fawn said I cant remember here So they walked on together though the wood Alice with her arms clasped lovingly round the soft neck of the Fawn till they came out into another open field and here the Fawn gave a sudden bound into the air and shook itself free from Alices arms Im a Fawn it cried out in a voice of delight and dear me youre a human child A sudden look of alarm came into its beautiful brown eyes and in another moment it had darted away at full speed Alice stood looking after it almost ready to cry with vexation at having lost her dear little fellowtraveller so suddenly However I know my name now she said thats _some_ comfort AliceAliceI wont forget it again And now which of these fingerposts ought I to follow I wonder It was not a very difficult question to answer as there was only one road through the wood and the two fingerposts both pointed along it Ill settle it Alice said to herself when the road divides and they point different ways But this did not seem likely to happen She went on and on a long way but wherever the road divided there were sure to be two fingerposts pointing the same way one marked TO TWEEDLEDUMS HOUSE and the other TO THE HOUSE OF TWEEDLEDEE I do believe said Alice at last that they live in the same house I wonder I never thought of that beforeBut I cant stay there long Ill just call and say how dyou do and ask them the way out of the wood If I could only get to the Eighth Square before it gets dark So she wandered on talking to herself as she went till on turning a sharp corner she came upon two fat little men so suddenly that she could not help starting back but in another moment she recovered herself feeling sure that they must be CHAPTER IV Tweedledum And Tweedledee They were standing under a tree each with an arm round the others neck and Alice knew which was which in a moment because one of them had DUM embroidered on his collar and the other DEE I suppose theyve each got TWEEDLE round at the back of the collar she said to herself They stood so still that she quite forgot they were alive and she was just looking round to see if the word TWEEDLE was written at the back of each collar when she was startled by a voice coming from the one marked DUM If you think were waxworks he said you ought to pay you know Waxworks werent made to be looked at for nothing nohow Contrariwise added the one marked DEE if you think were alive you ought to speak Im sure Im very sorry was all Alice could say for the words of the old song kept ringing through her head like the ticking of a clock and she could hardly help saying them out loud Tweedledum and Tweedledee Agreed to have a battle For Tweedledum said Tweedledee Had spoiled his nice new rattle Just then flew down a monstrous crow As black as a tarbarrel Which frightened both the heroes so They quite forgot their quarrel I know what youre thinking about said Tweedledum but it isnt so nohow Contrariwise continued Tweedledee if it was so it might be and if it were so it would be but as it isnt it aint Thats logic I was thinking Alice said very politely which is the best way out of this wood its getting so dark Would you tell me please But the little men only looked at each other and grinned They looked so exactly like a couple of great schoolboys that Alice couldnt help pointing her finger at Tweedledum and saying First Boy Nohow Tweedledum cried out briskly and shut his mouth up again with a snap Next Boy said Alice passing on to Tweedledee though she felt quite certain he would only shout out Contrariwise and so he did Youve been wrong cried Tweedledum The first thing in a visit is to say How dye do and shake hands And here the two brothers gave each other a hug and then they held out the two hands that were free to shake hands with her Alice did not like shaking hands with either of them first for fear of hurting the other ones feelings so as the best way out of the difficulty she took hold of both hands at once the next moment they were dancing round in a ring This seemed quite natural she remembered afterwards and she was not even surprised to hear music playing it seemed to come from the tree under which they were dancing and it was done as well as she could make it out by the branches rubbing one across the other like fiddles and fiddlesticks But it certainly _was_ funny Alice said afterwards when she was telling her sister the history of all this to find myself singing _Here we go round the mulberry bush_ I dont know when I began it but somehow I felt as if Id been singing it a long long time The other two dancers were fat and very soon out of breath Four times round is enough for one dance Tweedledum panted out and they left off dancing as suddenly as they had begun the music stopped at the same moment Then they let go of Alices hands and stood looking at her for a minute there was a rather awkward pause as Alice didnt know how to begin a conversation with people she had just been dancing with It would never do to say How dye do _now_ she said to herself we seem to have got beyond that somehow I hope youre not much tired she said at last Nohow And thank you _very_ much for asking said Tweedledum So _much_ obliged added Tweedledee You like poetry Yees pretty well_some_ poetry Alice said doubtfully Would you tell me which road leads out of the wood What shall I repeat to her said Tweedledee looking round at Tweedledum with great solemn eyes and not noticing Alices question _The Walrus and the Carpenter_ is the longest Tweedledum replied giving his brother an affectionate hug Tweedledee began instantly The sun was shining Here Alice ventured to interrupt him If its _very_ long she said as politely as she could would you please tell me first which road Tweedledee smiled gently and began again The sun was shining on the sea Shining with all his might He did his very best to make The billows smooth and bright And this was odd because it was The middle of the night The moon was shining sulkily Because she thought the sun Had got no business to be there After the day was done Its very rude of him she said To come and spoil the fun The sea was wet as wet could be The sands were dry as dry You could not see a cloud because No cloud was in the sky No birds were flying over head There were no birds to fly The Walrus and the Carpenter Were walking close at hand They wept like anything to see Such quantities of sand If this were only cleared away They said it _would_ be grand If seven maids with seven mops Swept it for half a year Do you suppose the Walrus said That they could get it clear I doubt it said the Carpenter And shed a bitter tear O Oysters come and walk with us The Walrus did beseech A pleasant walk a pleasant talk Along the briny beach We cannot do with more than four To give a hand to each The eldest Oyster looked at him But never a word he said The eldest Oyster winked his eye And shook his heavy head Meaning to say he did not choose To leave the oysterbed But four young oysters hurried up All eager for the treat Their coats were brushed their faces washed Their shoes were clean and neat And this was odd because you know They hadnt any feet Four other Oysters followed them And yet another four And thick and fast they came at last And more and more and more All hopping through the frothy waves And scrambling to the shore The Walrus and the Carpenter Walked on a mile or so And then they rested on a rock Conveniently low And all the little Oysters stood And waited in a row The time has come the Walrus said To talk of many things Of shoesand shipsand sealingwax Of cabbagesand kings And why the sea is boiling hot And whether pigs have wings But wait a bit the Oysters cried Before we have our chat For some of us are out of breath And all of us are fat No hurry said the Carpenter They thanked him much for that A loaf of bread the Walrus said Is what we chiefly need Pepper and vinegar besides Are very good indeed Now if youre ready Oysters dear We can begin to feed But not on us the Oysters cried Turning a little blue After such kindness that would be A dismal thing to do The night is fine the Walrus said Do you admire the view It was so kind of you to come And you are very nice The Carpenter said nothing but Cut us another slice I wish you were not quite so deaf Ive had to ask you twice It seems a shame the Walrus said To play them such a trick After weve brought them out so far And made them trot so quick The Carpenter said nothing but The butters spread too thick I weep for you the Walrus said I deeply sympathize With sobs and tears he sorted out Those of the largest size Holding his pocket handkerchief Before his streaming eyes O Oysters said the Carpenter Youve had a pleasant run Shall we be trotting home again But answer came there none And that was scarcely odd because Theyd eaten every one I like the Walrus best said Alice because you see he was a _little_ sorry for the poor oysters He ate more than the Carpenter though said Tweedledee You see he held his handkerchief in front so that the Carpenter couldnt count how many he took contrariwise That was mean Alice said indignantly Then I like the Carpenter bestif he didnt eat so many as the Walrus But he ate as many as he could get said Tweedledum This was a puzzler After a pause Alice began Well They were _both_ very unpleasant characters Here she checked herself in some alarm at hearing something that sounded to her like the puffing of a large steamengine in the wood near them though she feared it was more likely to be a wild beast Are there any lions or tigers about here she asked timidly Its only the Red King snoring said Tweedledee Come and look at him the brothers cried and they each took one of Alices hands and led her up to where the King was sleeping Isnt he a _lovely_ sight said Tweedledum Alice couldnt say honestly that he was He had a tall red nightcap on with a tassel and he was lying crumpled up into a sort of untidy heap and snoring loudfit to snore his head off as Tweedledum remarked Im afraid hell catch cold with lying on the damp grass said Alice who was a very thoughtful little girl Hes dreaming now said Tweedledee and what do you think hes dreaming about Alice said Nobody can guess that Why about _you_ Tweedledee exclaimed clapping his hands triumphantly And if he left off dreaming about you where do you suppose youd be Where I am now of course said Alice Not you Tweedledee retorted contemptuously Youd be nowhere Why youre only a sort of thing in his dream If that there King was to wake added Tweedledum youd go outbangjust like a candle I shouldnt Alice exclaimed indignantly Besides if _Im_ only a sort of thing in his dream what are _you_ I should like to know Ditto said Tweedledum Ditto ditto cried Tweedledee He shouted this so loud that Alice couldnt help saying Hush Youll be waking him Im afraid if you make so much noise Well it no use _your_ talking about waking him said Tweedledum when youre only one of the things in his dream You know very well youre not real I _am_ real said Alice and began to cry You wont make yourself a bit realler by crying Tweedledee remarked theres nothing to cry about If I wasnt real Alice saidhalflaughing through her tears it all seemed so ridiculousI shouldnt be able to cry I hope you dont suppose those are real tears Tweedledum interrupted in a tone of great contempt I know theyre talking nonsense Alice thought to herself and its foolish to cry about it So she brushed away her tears and went on as cheerfully as she could At any rate Id better be getting out of the wood for really its coming on very dark Do you think its going to rain Tweedledum spread a large umbrella over himself and his brother and looked up into it No I dont think it is he said at leastnot under _here_ Nohow But it may rain _outside_ It mayif it chooses said Tweedledee weve no objection Contrariwise Selfish things thought Alice and she was just going to say Goodnight and leave them when Tweedledum sprang out from under the umbrella and seized her by the wrist Do you see _that_ he said in a voice choking with passion and his eyes grew large and yellow all in a moment as he pointed with a trembling finger at a small white thing lying under the tree Its only a rattle Alice said after a careful examination of the little white thing Not a rattle_snake_ you know she added hastily thinking that he was frightened only an old rattlequite old and broken I knew it was cried Tweedledum beginning to stamp about wildly and tear his hair Its spoilt of course Here he looked at Tweedledee who immediately sat down on the ground and tried to hide himself under the umbrella Alice laid her hand upon his arm and said in a soothing tone You neednt be so angry about an old rattle But it isnt old Tweedledum cried in a greater fury than ever Its new I tell youI bought it yesterdaymy nice new RATTLE and his voice rose to a perfect scream All this time Tweedledee was trying his best to fold up the umbrella with himself in it which was such an extraordinary thing to do that it quite took off Alices attention from the angry brother But he couldnt quite succeed and it ended in his rolling over bundled up in the umbrella with only his head out and there he lay opening and shutting his mouth and his large eyeslooking more like a fish than anything else Alice thought Of course you agree to have a battle Tweedledum said in a calmer tone I suppose so the other sulkily replied as he crawled out of the umbrella only _she_ must help us to dress up you know So the two brothers went off handinhand into the wood and returned in a minute with their arms full of thingssuch as bolsters blankets hearthrugs tablecloths dishcovers and coalscuttles I hope youre a good hand at pinning and tying strings Tweedledum remarked Every one of these things has got to go on somehow or other Alice said afterwards she had never seen such a fuss made about anything in all her lifethe way those two bustled aboutand the quantity of things they put onand the trouble they gave her in tying strings and fastening buttonsReally theyll be more like bundles of old clothes than anything else by the time theyre ready she said to herself as she arranged a bolster round the neck of Tweedledee to keep his head from being cut off as he said You know he added very gravely its one of the most serious things that can possibly happen to one in a battleto get ones head cut off Alice laughed aloud but she managed to turn it into a cough for fear of hurting his feelings Do I look very pale said Tweedledum coming up to have his helmet tied on He _called_ it a helmet though it certainly looked much more like a saucepan Wellyesa _little_ Alice replied gently Im very brave generally he went on in a low voice only today I happen to have a headache And _Ive_ got a toothache said Tweedledee who had overheard the remark Im far worse off than you Then youd better not fight today said Alice thinking it a good opportunity to make peace We _must_ have a bit of a fight but I dont care about going on long said Tweedledum Whats the time now Tweedledee looked at his watch and said Halfpast four Lets fight till six and then have dinner said Tweedledum Very well the other said rather sadly and _she_ can watch usonly youd better not come _very_ close he added I generally hit everything I can seewhen I get really excited And _I_ hit everything within reach cried Tweedledum whether I can see it or not Alice laughed You must hit the _trees_ pretty often I should think she said Tweedledum looked round him with a satisfied smile I dont suppose he said therell be a tree left standing for ever so far round by the time weve finished And all about a rattle said Alice still hoping to make them a _little_ ashamed of fighting for such a trifle I shouldnt have minded it so much said Tweedledum if it hadnt been a new one I wish the monstrous crow would come thought Alice Theres only one sword you know Tweedledum said to his brother but you can have the umbrellaits quite as sharp Only we must begin quick Its getting as dark as it can And darker said Tweedledee It was getting dark so suddenly that Alice thought there must be a thunderstorm coming on What a thick black cloud that is she said And how fast it comes Why I do believe its got wings Its the crow Tweedledum cried out in a shrill voice of alarm and the two brothers took to their heels and were out of sight in a moment Alice ran a little way into the wood and stopped under a large tree It can never get at me _here_ she thought its far too large to squeeze itself in among the trees But I wish it wouldnt flap its wings soit makes quite a hurricane in the woodheres somebodys shawl being blown away CHAPTER V Wool and Water She caught the shawl as she spoke and looked about for the owner in another moment the White Queen came running wildly through the wood with both arms stretched out wide as if she were flying and Alice very civilly went to meet her with the shawl Im very glad I happened to be in the way Alice said as she helped her to put on her shawl again The White Queen only looked at her in a helpless frightened sort of way and kept repeating something in a whisper to herself that sounded like breadandbutter breadandbutter and Alice felt that if there was to be any conversation at all she must manage it herself So she began rather timidly Am I addressing the White Queen Well yes if you call that adressing The Queen said It isnt _my_ notion of the thing at all Alice thought it would never do to have an argument at the very beginning of their conversation so she smiled and said If your Majesty will only tell me the right way to begin Ill do it as well as I can But I dont want it done at all groaned the poor Queen Ive been adressing myself for the last two hours It would have been all the better as it seemed to Alice if she had got some one else to dress her she was so dreadfully untidy Every single things crooked Alice thought to herself and shes all over pinsmay I put your shawl straight for you she added aloud I dont know whats the matter with it the Queen said in a melancholy voice Its out of temper I think Ive pinned it here and Ive pinned it there but theres no pleasing it It _cant_ go straight you know if you pin it all on one side Alice said as she gently put it right for her and dear me what a state your hair is in The brush has got entangled in it the Queen said with a sigh And I lost the comb yesterday Alice carefully released the brush and did her best to get the hair into order Come you look rather better now she said after altering most of the pins But really you should have a ladys maid Im sure Ill take you with pleasure the Queen said Twopence a week and jam every other day Alice couldnt help laughing as she said I dont want you to hire _me_and I dont care for jam Its very good jam said the Queen Well I dont want any _today_ at any rate You couldnt have it if you _did_ want it the Queen said The rule is jam tomorrow and jam yesterdaybut never jam today It _must_ come sometimes to jam today Alice objected No it cant said the Queen Its jam every _other_ day today isnt any _other_ day you know I dont understand you said Alice Its dreadfully confusing Thats the effect of living backwards the Queen said kindly it always makes one a little giddy at first Living backwards Alice repeated in great astonishment I never heard of such a thing but theres one great advantage in it that ones memory works both ways Im sure _mine_ only works one way Alice remarked I cant remember things before they happen Its a poor sort of memory that only works backwards the Queen remarked What sort of things do _you_ remember best Alice ventured to ask Oh things that happened the week after next the Queen replied in a careless tone For instance now she went on sticking a large piece of plaster on her finger as she spoke theres the Kings Messenger Hes in prison now being punished and the trial doesnt even begin till next Wednesday and of course the crime comes last of all Suppose he never commits the crime said Alice That would be all the better wouldnt it the Queen said as she bound the plaster round her finger with a bit of ribbon Alice felt there was no denying _that_ Of course it would be all the better she said but it wouldnt be all the better his being punished Youre wrong _there_ at any rate said the Queen were _you_ ever punished Only for faults said Alice And you were all the better for it I know the Queen said triumphantly Yes but then I _had_ done the things I was punished for said Alice that makes all the difference But if you _hadnt_ done them the Queen said that would have been better still better and better and better Her voice went higher with each better till it got quite to a squeak at last Alice was just beginning to say Theres a mistake somewhere when the Queen began screaming so loud that she had to leave the sentence unfinished Oh oh oh shouted the Queen shaking her hand about as if she wanted to shake it off My fingers bleeding Oh oh oh oh Her screams were so exactly like the whistle of a steamengine that Alice had to hold both her hands over her ears What _is_ the matter she said as soon as there was a chance of making herself heard Have you pricked your finger I havent pricked it _yet_ the Queen said but I soon shalloh oh oh When do you expect to do it Alice asked feeling very much inclined to laugh When I fasten my shawl again the poor Queen groaned out the brooch will come undone directly Oh oh As she said the words the brooch flew open and the Queen clutched wildly at it and tried to clasp it again Take care cried Alice Youre holding it all crooked And she caught at the brooch but it was too late the pin had slipped and the Queen had pricked her finger That accounts for the bleeding you see she said to Alice with a smile Now you understand the way things happen here But why dont you scream now Alice asked holding her hands ready to put over her ears again Why Ive done all the screaming already said the Queen What would be the good of having it all over again By this time it was getting light The crow must have flown away I think said Alice Im so glad its gone I thought it was the night coming on I wish _I_ could manage to be glad the Queen said Only I never can remember the rule You must be very happy living in this wood and being glad whenever you like Only it is so _very_ lonely here Alice said in a melancholy voice and at the thought of her loneliness two large tears came rolling down her cheeks Oh dont go on like that cried the poor Queen wringing her hands in despair Consider what a great girl you are Consider what a long way youve come today Consider what oclock it is Consider anything only dont cry Alice could not help laughing at this even in the midst of her tears Can _you_ keep from crying by considering things she asked Thats the way its done the Queen said with great decision nobody can do two things at once you know Lets consider your age to begin withhow old are you Im seven and a half exactly You neednt say exactually the Queen remarked I can believe it without that Now Ill give _you_ something to believe Im just one hundred and one five months and a day I cant believe _that_ said Alice Cant you the Queen said in a pitying tone Try again draw a long breath and shut your eyes Alice laughed Theres no use trying she said one _cant_ believe impossible things I daresay you havent had much practice said the Queen When I was your age I always did it for halfanhour a day Why sometimes Ive believed as many as six impossible things before breakfast There goes the shawl again The brooch had come undone as she spoke and a sudden gust of wind blew the Queens shawl across a little brook The Queen spread out her arms again and went flying after it and this time she succeeded in catching it for herself Ive got it she cried in a triumphant tone Now you shall see me pin it on again all by myself Then I hope your finger is better now Alice said very politely as she crossed the little brook after the Queen Oh much better cried the Queen her voice rising to a squeak as she went on Much beetter Beetter Beeeetter Beeehh The last word ended in a long bleat so like a sheep that Alice quite started She looked at the Queen who seemed to have suddenly wrapped herself up in wool Alice rubbed her eyes and looked again She couldnt make out what had happened at all Was she in a shop And was that reallywas it really a _sheep_ that was sitting on the other side of the counter Rub as she could she could make nothing more of it she was in a little dark shop leaning with her elbows on the counter and opposite to her was an old Sheep sitting in an armchair knitting and every now and then leaving off to look at her through a great pair of spectacles What is it you want to buy the Sheep said at last looking up for a moment from her knitting I dont _quite_ know yet Alice said very gently I should like to look all round me first if I might You may look in front of you and on both sides if you like said the Sheep but you cant look _all_ round youunless youve got eyes at the back of your head But these as it happened Alice had _not_ got so she contented herself with turning round looking at the shelves as she came to them The shop seemed to be full of all manner of curious thingsbut the oddest part of it all was that whenever she looked hard at any shelf to make out exactly what it had on it that particular shelf was always quite empty though the others round it were crowded as full as they could hold Things flow about so here she said at last in a plaintive tone after she had spent a minute or so in vainly pursuing a large bright thing that looked sometimes like a doll and sometimes like a workbox and was always in the shelf next above the one she was looking at And this one is the most provoking of allbut Ill tell you what she added as a sudden thought struck her Ill follow it up to the very top shelf of all Itll puzzle it to go through the ceiling I expect But even this plan failed the thing went through the ceiling as quietly as possible as if it were quite used to it Are you a child or a teetotum the Sheep said as she took up another pair of needles Youll make me giddy soon if you go on turning round like that She was now working with fourteen pairs at once and Alice couldnt help looking at her in great astonishment How _can_ she knit with so many the puzzled child thought to herself She gets more and more like a porcupine every minute Can you row the Sheep asked handing her a pair of knittingneedles as she spoke Yes a littlebut not on landand not with needles Alice was beginning to say when suddenly the needles turned into oars in her hands and she found they were in a little boat gliding along between banks so there was nothing for it but to do her best Feather cried the Sheep as she took up another pair of needles This didnt sound like a remark that needed any answer so Alice said nothing but pulled away There was something very queer about the water she thought as every now and then the oars got fast in it and would hardly come out again Feather Feather the Sheep cried again taking more needles Youll be catching a crab directly A dear little crab thought Alice I should like that Didnt you hear me say Feather the Sheep cried angrily taking up quite a bunch of needles Indeed I did said Alice youve said it very oftenand very loud Please where _are_ the crabs In the water of course said the Sheep sticking some of the needles into her hair as her hands were full Feather I say _Why_ do you say feather so often Alice asked at last rather vexed Im not a bird You are said the Sheep youre a little goose This offended Alice a little so there was no more conversation for a minute or two while the boat glided gently on sometimes among beds of weeds which made the oars stick fast in the water worse then ever and sometimes under trees but always with the same tall riverbanks frowning over their heads Oh please There are some scented rushes Alice cried in a sudden transport of delight There really areand _such_ beauties You neednt say please to _me_ about em the Sheep said without looking up from her knitting I didnt put em there and Im not going to take em away No but I meantplease may we wait and pick some Alice pleaded If you dont mind stopping the boat for a minute How am _I_ to stop it said the Sheep If you leave off rowing itll stop of itself So the boat was left to drift down the stream as it would till it glided gently in among the waving rushes And then the little sleeves were carefully rolled up and the little arms were plunged in elbowdeep to get the rushes a good long way down before breaking them offand for a while Alice forgot all about the Sheep and the knitting as she bent over the side of the boat with just the ends of her tangled hair dipping into the waterwhile with bright eager eyes she caught at one bunch after another of the darling scented rushes I only hope the boat wont tipple over she said to herself Oh _what_ a lovely one Only I couldnt quite reach it And it certainly _did_ seem a little provoking almost as if it happened on purpose she thought that though she managed to pick plenty of beautiful rushes as the boat glided by there was always a more lovely one that she couldnt reach The prettiest are always further she said at last with a sigh at the obstinacy of the rushes in growing so far off as with flushed cheeks and dripping hair and hands she scrambled back into her place and began to arrange her newfound treasures What mattered it to her just then that the rushes had begun to fade and to lose all their scent and beauty from the very moment that she picked them Even real scented rushes you know last only a very little whileand these being dreamrushes melted away almost like snow as they lay in heaps at her feetbut Alice hardly noticed this there were so many other curious things to think about They hadnt gone much farther before the blade of one of the oars got fast in the water and _wouldnt_ come out again so Alice explained it afterwards and the consequence was that the handle of it caught her under the chin and in spite of a series of little shrieks of Oh oh oh from poor Alice it swept her straight off the seat and down among the heap of rushes However she wasnt hurt and was soon up again the Sheep went on with her knitting all the while just as if nothing had happened That was a nice crab you caught she remarked as Alice got back into her place very much relieved to find herself still in the boat Was it I didnt see it Said Alice peeping cautiously over the side of the boat into the dark water I wish it hadnt let goI should so like to see a little crab to take home with me But the Sheep only laughed scornfully and went on with her knitting Are there many crabs here said Alice Crabs and all sorts of things said the Sheep plenty of choice only make up your mind Now what _do_ you want to buy To buy Alice echoed in a tone that was half astonished and half frightenedfor the oars and the boat and the river had vanished all in a moment and she was back again in the little dark shop I should like to buy an egg please she said timidly How do you sell them Fivepence farthing for oneTwopence for two the Sheep replied Then two are cheaper than one Alice said in a surprised tone taking out her purse Only you _must_ eat them both if you buy two said the Sheep Then Ill have _one_ please said Alice as she put the money down on the counter For she thought to herself They mightnt be at all nice you know The Sheep took the money and put it away in a box then she said I never put things into peoples handsthat would never doyou must get it for yourself And so saying she went off to the other end of the shop and set the egg upright on a shelf I wonder _why_ it wouldnt do thought Alice as she groped her way among the tables and chairs for the shop was very dark towards the end The egg seems to get further away the more I walk towards it Let me see is this a chair Why its got branches I declare How very odd to find trees growing here And actually heres a little brook Well this is the very queerest shop I ever saw So she went on wondering more and more at every step as everything turned into a tree the moment she came up to it and she quite expected the egg to do the same CHAPTER VI Humpty Dumpty However the egg only got larger and larger and more and more human when she had come within a few yards of it she saw that it had eyes and a nose and mouth and when she had come close to it she saw clearly that it was HUMPTY DUMPTY himself It cant be anybody else she said to herself Im as certain of it as if his name were written all over his face It might have been written a hundred times easily on that enormous face Humpty Dumpty was sitting with his legs crossed like a Turk on the top of a high wallsuch a narrow one that Alice quite wondered how he could keep his balanceand as his eyes were steadily fixed in the opposite direction and he didnt take the least notice of her she thought he must be a stuffed figure after all And how exactly like an egg he is she said aloud standing with her hands ready to catch him for she was every moment expecting him to fall Its _very_ provoking Humpty Dumpty said after a long silence looking away from Alice as he spoke to be called an egg_Very_ I said you _looked_ like an egg Sir Alice gently explained And some eggs are very pretty you know she added hoping to turn her remark into a sort of a compliment Some people said Humpty Dumpty looking away from her as usual have no more sense than a baby Alice didnt know what to say to this it wasnt at all like conversation she thought as he never said anything to _her_ in fact his last remark was evidently addressed to a treeso she stood and softly repeated to herself Humpty Dumpty sat on a wall Humpty Dumpty had a great fall All the Kings horses and all the Kings men Couldnt put Humpty Dumpty in his place again That last line is much too long for the poetry she added almost out loud forgetting that Humpty Dumpty would hear her Dont stand there chattering to yourself like that Humpty Dumpty said looking at her for the first time but tell me your name and your business My _name_ is Alice but Its a stupid enough name Humpty Dumpty interrupted impatiently What does it mean _Must_ a name mean something Alice asked doubtfully Of course it must Humpty Dumpty said with a short laugh _my_ name means the shape I amand a good handsome shape it is too With a name like yours you might be any shape almost Why do you sit out here all alone said Alice not wishing to begin an argument Why because theres nobody with me cried Humpty Dumpty Did you think I didnt know the answer to _that_ Ask another Dont you think youd be safer down on the ground Alice went on not with any idea of making another riddle but simply in her goodnatured anxiety for the queer creature That wall is so _very_ narrow What tremendously easy riddles you ask Humpty Dumpty growled out Of course I dont think so Why if ever I _did_ fall offwhich theres no chance ofbut _if_ I did Here he pursed his lips and looked so solemn and grand that Alice could hardly help laughing _If_ I did fall he went on _The King has promised mewith his very own mouth_toto To send all his horses and all his men Alice interrupted rather unwisely Now I declare thats too bad Humpty Dumpty cried breaking into a sudden passion Youve been listening at doorsand behind treesand down chimneysor you couldnt have known it I havent indeed Alice said very gently Its in a book Ah well They may write such things in a _book_ Humpty Dumpty said in a calmer tone Thats what you call a History of England that is Now take a good look at me Im one that has spoken to a King _I_ am mayhap youll never see such another and to show you Im not proud you may shake hands with me And he grinned almost from ear to ear as he leant forwards and as nearly as possible fell off the wall in doing so and offered Alice his hand She watched him a little anxiously as she took it If he smiled much more the ends of his mouth might meet behind she thought and then I dont know what would happen to his head Im afraid it would come off Yes all his horses and all his men Humpty Dumpty went on Theyd pick me up again in a minute _they_ would However this conversation is going on a little too fast lets go back to the last remark but one Im afraid I cant quite remember it Alice said very politely In that case we start fresh said Humpty Dumpty and its my turn to choose a subject He talks about it just as if it was a game thought Alice So heres a question for you How old did you say you were Alice made a short calculation and said Seven years and six months Wrong Humpty Dumpty exclaimed triumphantly You never said a word like it I though you meant How old _are_ you Alice explained If Id meant that Id have said it said Humpty Dumpty Alice didnt want to begin another argument so she said nothing Seven years and six months Humpty Dumpty repeated thoughtfully An uncomfortable sort of age Now if youd asked _my_ advice Id have said Leave off at sevenbut its too late now I never ask advice about growing Alice said indignantly Too proud the other inquired Alice felt even more indignant at this suggestion I mean she said that one cant help growing older _One_ cant perhaps said Humpty Dumpty but _two_ can With proper assistance you might have left off at seven What a beautiful belt youve got on Alice suddenly remarked They had had quite enough of the subject of age she thought and if they really were to take turns in choosing subjects it was her turn now At least she corrected herself on second thoughts a beautiful cravat I should have saidno a belt I meanI beg your pardon she added in dismay for Humpty Dumpty looked thoroughly offended and she began to wish she hadnt chosen that subject If I only knew she thought to herself which was neck and which was waist Evidently Humpty Dumpty was very angry though he said nothing for a minute or two When he _did_ speak again it was in a deep growl It is a_mostprovoking_thing he said at last when a person doesnt know a cravat from a belt I know its very ignorant of me Alice said in so humble a tone that Humpty Dumpty relented Its a cravat child and a beautiful one as you say Its a present from the White King and Queen There now Is it really said Alice quite pleased to find that she _had_ chosen a good subject after all They gave it me Humpty Dumpty continued thoughtfully as he crossed one knee over the other and clasped his hands round it they gave it mefor an unbirthday present I beg your pardon Alice said with a puzzled air Im not offended said Humpty Dumpty I mean what _is_ an unbirthday present A present given when it isnt your birthday of course Alice considered a little I like birthday presents best she said at last You dont know what youre talking about cried Humpty Dumpty How many days are there in a year Three hundred and sixtyfive said Alice And how many birthdays have you One And if you take one from three hundred and sixtyfive what remains Three hundred and sixtyfour of course Humpty Dumpty looked doubtful Id rather see that done on paper he said Alice couldnt help smiling as she took out her memorandumbook and worked the sum for him 365 1 ____ 364 ___ Humpty Dumpty took the book and looked at it carefully That seems to be done right he began Youre holding it upside down Alice interrupted To be sure I was Humpty Dumpty said gaily as she turned it round for him I thought it looked a little queer As I was saying that _seems_ to be done rightthough I havent time to look it over thoroughly just nowand that shows that there are three hundred and sixtyfour days when you might get unbirthday presents Certainly said Alice And only _one_ for birthday presents you know Theres glory for you I dont know what you mean by glory Alice said Humpty Dumpty smiled contemptuously Of course you donttill I tell you I meant theres a nice knockdown argument for you But glory doesnt mean a nice knockdown argument Alice objected When _I_ use a word Humpty Dumpty said in rather a scornful tone it means just what I choose it to meanneither more nor less The question is said Alice whether you _can_ make words mean so many different things The question is said Humpty Dumpty which is to be masterthats all Alice was too much puzzled to say anything so after a minute Humpty Dumpty began again Theyve a temper some of themparticularly verbs theyre the proudestadjectives you can do anything with but not verbshowever _I_ can manage the whole lot of them Impenetrability Thats what _I_ say Would you tell me please said Alice what that means Now you talk like a reasonable child said Humpty Dumpty looking very much pleased I meant by impenetrability that weve had enough of that subject and it would be just as well if youd mention what you mean to do next as I suppose you dont mean to stop here all the rest of your life Thats a great deal to make one word mean Alice said in a thoughtful tone When I make a word do a lot of work like that said Humpty Dumpty I always pay it extra Oh said Alice She was too much puzzled to make any other remark Ah you should see em come round me of a Saturday night Humpty Dumpty went on wagging his head gravely from side to side for to get their wages you know Alice didnt venture to ask what he paid them with and so you see I cant tell _you_ You seem very clever at explaining words Sir said Alice Would you kindly tell me the meaning of the poem called Jabberwocky Lets hear it said Humpty Dumpty I can explain all the poems that were ever inventedand a good many that havent been invented just yet This sounded very hopeful so Alice repeated the first verse Twas brillig and the slithy toves Did gyre and gimble in the wabe All mimsy were the borogoves And the mome raths outgrabe Thats enough to begin with Humpty Dumpty interrupted there are plenty of hard words there _Brillig_ means four oclock in the afternoonthe time when you begin _broiling_ things for dinner Thatll do very well said Alice and _slithy_ Well _slithy_ means lithe and slimy Lithe is the same as active You see its like a portmanteauthere are two meanings packed up into one word I see it now Alice remarked thoughtfully and what are _toves_ Well _toves_ are something like badgerstheyre something like lizardsand theyre something like corkscrews They must be very curious looking creatures They are that said Humpty Dumpty also they make their nests under sundialsalso they live on cheese And whats the _gyre_ and to _gimble_ To _gyre_ is to go round and round like a gyroscope To _gimble_ is to make holes like a gimlet And _the wabe_ is the grassplot round a sundial I suppose said Alice surprised at her own ingenuity Of course it is Its called _wabe_ you know because it goes a long way before it and a long way behind it And a long way beyond it on each side Alice added Exactly so Well then _mimsy_ is flimsy and miserable theres another portmanteau for you And a _borogove_ is a thin shabbylooking bird with its feathers sticking out all roundsomething like a live mop And then _mome raths_ said Alice Im afraid Im giving you a great deal of trouble Well a _rath_ is a sort of green pig but _mome_ Im not certain about I think its short for from homemeaning that theyd lost their way you know And what does _outgrabe_ mean Well _outgrabing_ is something between bellowing and whistling with a kind of sneeze in the middle however youll hear it done maybedown in the wood yonderand when youve once heard it youll be _quite_ content Whos been repeating all that hard stuff to you I read it in a book said Alice But I had some poetry repeated to me much easier than that byTweedledee I think it was As to poetry you know said Humpty Dumpty stretching out one of his great hands _I_ can repeat poetry as well as other folk if it comes to that Oh it neednt come to that Alice hastily said hoping to keep him from beginning The piece Im going to repeat he went on without noticing her remark was written entirely for your amusement Alice felt that in that case she really _ought_ to listen to it so she sat down and said Thank you rather sadly In winter when the fields are white I sing this song for your delight only I dont sing it he added as an explanation I see you dont said Alice If you can _see_ whether Im singing or not youve sharper eyes than most Humpty Dumpty remarked severely Alice was silent In spring when woods are getting green Ill try and tell you what I mean Thank you very much said Alice In summer when the days are long Perhaps youll understand the song In autumn when the leaves are brown Take pen and ink and write it down I will if I can remember it so long said Alice You neednt go on making remarks like that Humpty Dumpty said theyre not sensible and they put me out I sent a message to the fish I told them This is what I wish The little fishes of the sea They sent an answer back to me The little fishes answer was We cannot do it Sir because Im afraid I dont quite understand said Alice It gets easier further on Humpty Dumpty replied I sent to them again to say It will be better to obey The fishes answered with a grin Why what a temper you are in I told them once I told them twice They would not listen to advice I took a kettle large and new Fit for the deed I had to do My heart went hop my heart went thump I filled the kettle at the pump Then some one came to me and said The little fishes are in bed I said to him I said it plain Then you must wake them up again I said it very loud and clear I went and shouted in his ear Humpty Dumpty raised his voice almost to a scream as he repeated this verse and Alice thought with a shudder I wouldnt have been the messenger for _anything_ But he was very stiff and proud He said You neednt shout so loud And he was very proud and stiff He said Id go and wake them if I took a corkscrew from the shelf I went to wake them up myself And when I found the door was locked I pulled and pushed and kicked and knocked And when I found the door was shut I tried to turn the handle but There was a long pause Is that all Alice timidly asked Thats all said Humpty Dumpty Goodbye This was rather sudden Alice thought but after such a _very_ strong hint that she ought to be going she felt that it would hardly be civil to stay So she got up and held out her hand Goodbye till we meet again she said as cheerfully as she could I shouldnt know you again if we _did_ meet Humpty Dumpty replied in a discontented tone giving her one of his fingers to shake youre so exactly like other people The face is what one goes by generally Alice remarked in a thoughtful tone Thats just what I complain of said Humpty Dumpty Your face is the same as everybody hasthe two eyes so marking their places in the air with this thumb nose in the middle mouth under Its always the same Now if you had the two eyes on the same side of the nose for instanceor the mouth at the topthat would be _some_ help It wouldnt look nice Alice objected But Humpty Dumpty only shut his eyes and said Wait till youve tried Alice waited a minute to see if he would speak again but as he never opened his eyes or took any further notice of her she said Goodbye once more and getting no answer to this she quietly walked away but she couldnt help saying to herself as she went Of all the unsatisfactory she repeated this aloud as it was a great comfort to have such a long word to say of all the unsatisfactory people I _ever_ met She never finished the sentence for at this moment a heavy crash shook the forest from end to end CHAPTER VII The Lion and the Unicorn The next moment soldiers came running through the wood at first in twos and threes then ten or twenty together and at last in such crowds that they seemed to fill the whole forest Alice got behind a tree for fear of being run over and watched them go by She thought that in all her life she had never seen soldiers so uncertain on their feet they were always tripping over something or other and whenever one went down several more always fell over him so that the ground was soon covered with little heaps of men Then came the horses Having four feet these managed rather better than the footsoldiers but even _they_ stumbled now and then and it seemed to be a regular rule that whenever a horse stumbled the rider fell off instantly The confusion got worse every moment and Alice was very glad to get out of the wood into an open place where she found the White King seated on the ground busily writing in his memorandumbook Ive sent them all the King cried in a tone of delight on seeing Alice Did you happen to meet any soldiers my dear as you came through the wood Yes I did said Alice several thousand I should think Four thousand two hundred and seven thats the exact number the King said referring to his book I couldnt send all the horses you know because two of them are wanted in the game And I havent sent the two Messengers either Theyre both gone to the town Just look along the road and tell me if you can see either of them I see nobody on the road said Alice I only wish _I_ had such eyes the King remarked in a fretful tone To be able to see Nobody And at that distance too Why its as much as _I_ can do to see real people by this light All this was lost on Alice who was still looking intently along the road shading her eyes with one hand I see somebody now she exclaimed at last But hes coming very slowlyand what curious attitudes he goes into For the messenger kept skipping up and down and wriggling like an eel as he came along with his great hands spread out like fans on each side Not at all said the King Hes an AngloSaxon Messengerand those are AngloSaxon attitudes He only does them when hes happy His name is Haigha He pronounced it so as to rhyme with mayor I love my love with an H Alice couldnt help beginning because he is Happy I hate him with an H because he is Hideous I fed him withwithwith Hamsandwiches and Hay His name is Haigha and he lives He lives on the Hill the King remarked simply without the least idea that he was joining in the game while Alice was still hesitating for the name of a town beginning with H The other Messengers called Hatta I must have _two_ you knowto come and go One to come and one to go I beg your pardon said Alice It isnt respectable to beg said the King I only meant that I didnt understand said Alice Why one to come and one to go Didnt I tell you the King repeated impatiently I must have _two_to fetch and carry One to fetch and one to carry At this moment the Messenger arrived he was far too much out of breath to say a word and could only wave his hands about and make the most fearful faces at the poor King This young lady loves you with an H the King said introducing Alice in the hope of turning off the Messengers attention from himselfbut it was no usethe AngloSaxon attitudes only got more extraordinary every moment while the great eyes rolled wildly from side to side You alarm me said the King I feel faintGive me a ham sandwich On which the Messenger to Alices great amusement opened a bag that hung round his neck and handed a sandwich to the King who devoured it greedily Another sandwich said the King Theres nothing but hay left now the Messenger said peeping into the bag Hay then the King murmured in a faint whisper Alice was glad to see that it revived him a good deal Theres nothing like eating hay when youre faint he remarked to her as he munched away I should think throwing cold water over you would be better Alice suggested or some salvolatile I didnt say there was nothing _better_ the King replied I said there was nothing _like_ it Which Alice did not venture to deny Who did you pass on the road the King went on holding out his hand to the Messenger for some more hay Nobody said the Messenger Quite right said the King this young lady saw him too So of course Nobody walks slower than you I do my best the Messenger said in a sulky tone Im sure nobody walks much faster than I do He cant do that said the King or else hed have been here first However now youve got your breath you may tell us whats happened in the town Ill whisper it said the Messenger putting his hands to his mouth in the shape of a trumpet and stooping so as to get close to the Kings ear Alice was sorry for this as she wanted to hear the news too However instead of whispering he simply shouted at the top of his voice Theyre at it again Do you call _that_ a whisper cried the poor King jumping up and shaking himself If you do such a thing again Ill have you buttered It went through and through my head like an earthquake It would have to be a very tiny earthquake thought Alice Who are at it again she ventured to ask Why the Lion and the Unicorn of course said the King Fighting for the crown Yes to be sure said the King and the best of the joke is that its _my_ crown all the while Lets run and see them And they trotted off Alice repeating to herself as she ran the words of the old song The Lion and the Unicorn were fighting for the crown The Lion beat the Unicorn all round the town Some gave them white bread some gave them brown Some gave them plumcake and drummed them out of town Doesthe onethat winsget the crown she asked as well as she could for the run was putting her quite out of breath Dear me no said the King What an idea Would yoube good enough Alice panted out after running a little further to stop a minutejust to getones breath again Im _good_ enough the King said only Im not strong enough You see a minute goes by so fearfully quick You might as well try to stop a Bandersnatch Alice had no more breath for talking so they trotted on in silence till they came in sight of a great crowd in the middle of which the Lion and Unicorn were fighting They were in such a cloud of dust that at first Alice could not make out which was which but she soon managed to distinguish the Unicorn by his horn They placed themselves close to where Hatta the other messenger was standing watching the fight with a cup of tea in one hand and a piece of breadandbutter in the other Hes only just out of prison and he hadnt finished his tea when he was sent in Haigha whispered to Alice and they only give them oystershells in thereso you see hes very hungry and thirsty How are you dear child he went on putting his arm affectionately round Hattas neck Hatta looked round and nodded and went on with his bread and butter Were you happy in prison dear child said Haigha Hatta looked round once more and this time a tear or two trickled down his cheek but not a word would he say Speak cant you Haigha cried impatiently But Hatta only munched away and drank some more tea Speak wont you cried the King How are they getting on with the fight Hatta made a desperate effort and swallowed a large piece of breadandbutter Theyre getting on very well he said in a choking voice each of them has been down about eightyseven times Then I suppose theyll soon bring the white bread and the brown Alice ventured to remark Its waiting for em now said Hatta this is a bit of it as Im eating There was a pause in the fight just then and the Lion and the Unicorn sat down panting while the King called out Ten minutes allowed for refreshments Haigha and Hatta set to work at once carrying rough trays of white and brown bread Alice took a piece to taste but it was _very_ dry I dont think theyll fight any more today the King said to Hatta go and order the drums to begin And Hatta went bounding away like a grasshopper For a minute or two Alice stood silent watching him Suddenly she brightened up Look look she cried pointing eagerly Theres the White Queen running across the country She came flying out of the wood over yonderHow fast those Queens _can_ run Theres some enemy after her no doubt the King said without even looking round That woods full of them But arent you going to run and help her Alice asked very much surprised at his taking it so quietly No use no use said the King She runs so fearfully quick You might as well try to catch a Bandersnatch But Ill make a memorandum about her if you likeShes a dear good creature he repeated softly to himself as he opened his memorandumbook Do you spell creature with a double e At this moment the Unicorn sauntered by them with his hands in his pockets I had the best of it this time he said to the King just glancing at him as he passed A littlea little the King replied rather nervously You shouldnt have run him through with your horn you know It didnt hurt him the Unicorn said carelessly and he was going on when his eye happened to fall upon Alice he turned round rather instantly and stood for some time looking at her with an air of the deepest disgust Whatisthis he said at last This is a child Haigha replied eagerly coming in front of Alice to introduce her and spreading out both his hands towards her in an AngloSaxon attitude We only found it today Its as large as life and twice as natural I always thought they were fabulous monsters said the Unicorn Is it alive It can talk said Haigha solemnly The Unicorn looked dreamily at Alice and said Talk child Alice could not help her lips curling up into a smile as she began Do you know I always thought Unicorns were fabulous monsters too I never saw one alive before Well now that we _have_ seen each other said the Unicorn if youll believe in me Ill believe in you Is that a bargain Yes if you like said Alice Come fetch out the plumcake old man the Unicorn went on turning from her to the King None of your brown bread for me Certainlycertainly the King muttered and beckoned to Haigha Open the bag he whispered Quick Not that onethats full of hay Haigha took a large cake out of the bag and gave it to Alice to hold while he got out a dish and carvingknife How they all came out of it Alice couldnt guess It was just like a conjuringtrick she thought The Lion had joined them while this was going on he looked very tired and sleepy and his eyes were half shut Whats this he said blinking lazily at Alice and speaking in a deep hollow tone that sounded like the tolling of a great bell Ah what _is_ it now the Unicorn cried eagerly Youll never guess _I_ couldnt The Lion looked at Alice wearily Are you animalvegetableor mineral he said yawning at every other word Its a fabulous monster the Unicorn cried out before Alice could reply Then hand round the plumcake Monster the Lion said lying down and putting his chin on his paws And sit down both of you to the King and the Unicorn fair play with the cake you know The King was evidently very uncomfortable at having to sit down between the two great creatures but there was no other place for him What a fight we might have for the crown _now_ the Unicorn said looking slyly up at the crown which the poor King was nearly shaking off his head he trembled so much I should win easy said the Lion Im not so sure of that said the Unicorn Why I beat you all round the town you chicken the Lion replied angrily half getting up as he spoke Here the King interrupted to prevent the quarrel going on he was very nervous and his voice quite quivered All round the town he said Thats a good long way Did you go by the old bridge or the marketplace You get the best view by the old bridge Im sure I dont know the Lion growled out as he lay down again There was too much dust to see anything What a time the Monster is cutting up that cake Alice had seated herself on the bank of a little brook with the great dish on her knees and was sawing away diligently with the knife Its very provoking she said in reply to the Lion she was getting quite used to being called the Monster Ive cut several slices already but they always join on again You dont know how to manage Lookingglass cakes the Unicorn remarked Hand it round first and cut it afterwards This sounded nonsense but Alice very obediently got up and carried the dish round and the cake divided itself into three pieces as she did so _Now_ cut it up said the Lion as she returned to her place with the empty dish I say this isnt fair cried the Unicorn as Alice sat with the knife in her hand very much puzzled how to begin The Monster has given the Lion twice as much as me Shes kept none for herself anyhow said the Lion Do you like plumcake Monster But before Alice could answer him the drums began Where the noise came from she couldnt make out the air seemed full of it and it rang through and through her head till she felt quite deafened She started to her feet and sprang across the little brook in her terror and had just time to see the Lion and the Unicorn rise to their feet with angry looks at being interrupted in their feast before she dropped to her knees and put her hands over her ears vainly trying to shut out the dreadful uproar If _that_ doesnt drum them out of town she thought to herself nothing ever will CHAPTER VIII Its my own Invention After a while the noise seemed gradually to die away till all was dead silence and Alice lifted up her head in some alarm There was no one to be seen and her first thought was that she must have been dreaming about the Lion and the Unicorn and those queer AngloSaxon Messengers However there was the great dish still lying at her feet on which she had tried to cut the plumcake So I wasnt dreaming after all she said to herself unlessunless were all part of the same dream Only I do hope its _my_ dream and not the Red Kings I dont like belonging to another persons dream she went on in a rather complaining tone Ive a great mind to go and wake him and see what happens At this moment her thoughts were interrupted by a loud shouting of Ahoy Ahoy Check and a Knight dressed in crimson armour came galloping down upon her brandishing a great club Just as he reached her the horse stopped suddenly Youre my prisoner the Knight cried as he tumbled off his horse Startled as she was Alice was more frightened for him than for herself at the moment and watched him with some anxiety as he mounted again As soon as he was comfortably in the saddle he began once more Youre my but here another voice broke in Ahoy Ahoy Check and Alice looked round in some surprise for the new enemy This time it was a White Knight He drew up at Alices side and tumbled off his horse just as the Red Knight had done then he got on again and the two Knights sat and looked at each other for some time without speaking Alice looked from one to the other in some bewilderment Shes _my_ prisoner you know the Red Knight said at last Yes but then _I_ came and rescued her the White Knight replied Well we must fight for her then said the Red Knight as he took up his helmet which hung from the saddle and was something the shape of a horses head and put it on You will observe the Rules of Battle of course the White Knight remarked putting on his helmet too I always do said the Red Knight and they began banging away at each other with such fury that Alice got behind a tree to be out of the way of the blows I wonder now what the Rules of Battle are she said to herself as she watched the fight timidly peeping out from her hidingplace one Rule seems to be that if one Knight hits the other he knocks him off his horse and if he misses he tumbles off himselfand another Rule seems to be that they hold their clubs with their arms as if they were Punch and JudyWhat a noise they make when they tumble Just like a whole set of fireirons falling into the fender And how quiet the horses are They let them get on and off them just as if they were tables Another Rule of Battle that Alice had not noticed seemed to be that they always fell on their heads and the battle ended with their both falling off in this way side by side when they got up again they shook hands and then the Red Knight mounted and galloped off It was a glorious victory wasnt it said the White Knight as he came up panting I dont know Alice said doubtfully I dont want to be anybodys prisoner I want to be a Queen So you will when youve crossed the next brook said the White Knight Ill see you safe to the end of the woodand then I must go back you know Thats the end of my move Thank you very much said Alice May I help you off with your helmet It was evidently more than he could manage by himself however she managed to shake him out of it at last Now one can breathe more easily said the Knight putting back his shaggy hair with both hands and turning his gentle face and large mild eyes to Alice She thought she had never seen such a strangelooking soldier in all her life He was dressed in tin armour which seemed to fit him very badly and he had a queershaped little deal box fastened across his shoulder upsidedown and with the lid hanging open Alice looked at it with great curiosity I see youre admiring my little box the Knight said in a friendly tone Its my own inventionto keep clothes and sandwiches in You see I carry it upsidedown so that the rain cant get in But the things can get _out_ Alice gently remarked Do you know the lids open I didnt know it the Knight said a shade of vexation passing over his face Then all the things must have fallen out And the box is no use without them He unfastened it as he spoke and was just going to throw it into the bushes when a sudden thought seemed to strike him and he hung it carefully on a tree Can you guess why I did that he said to Alice Alice shook her head In hopes some bees may make a nest in itthen I should get the honey But youve got a beehiveor something like onefastened to the saddle said Alice Yes its a very good beehive the Knight said in a discontented tone one of the best kind But not a single bee has come near it yet And the other thing is a mousetrap I suppose the mice keep the bees outor the bees keep the mice out I dont know which I was wondering what the mousetrap was for said Alice It isnt very likely there would be any mice on the horses back Not very likely perhaps said the Knight but if they _do_ come I dont choose to have them running all about You see he went on after a pause its as well to be provided for _everything_ Thats the reason the horse has all those anklets round his feet But what are they for Alice asked in a tone of great curiosity To guard against the bites of sharks the Knight replied Its an invention of my own And now help me on Ill go with you to the end of the woodWhats the dish for Its meant for plumcake said Alice Wed better take it with us the Knight said Itll come in handy if we find any plumcake Help me to get it into this bag This took a very long time to manage though Alice held the bag open very carefully because the Knight was so _very_ awkward in putting in the dish the first two or three times that he tried he fell in himself instead Its rather a tight fit you see he said as they got it in a last There are so many candlesticks in the bag And he hung it to the saddle which was already loaded with bunches of carrots and fireirons and many other things I hope youve got your hair well fastened on he continued as they set off Only in the usual way Alice said smiling Thats hardly enough he said anxiously You see the wind is so _very_ strong here Its as strong as soup Have you invented a plan for keeping the hair from being blown off Alice enquired Not yet said the Knight But Ive got a plan for keeping it from _falling_ off I should like to hear it very much First you take an upright stick said the Knight Then you make your hair creep up it like a fruittree Now the reason hair falls off is because it hangs _down_things never fall _upwards_ you know Its a plan of my own invention You may try it if you like It didnt sound a comfortable plan Alice thought and for a few minutes she walked on in silence puzzling over the idea and every now and then stopping to help the poor Knight who certainly was _not_ a good rider Whenever the horse stopped which it did very often he fell off in front and whenever it went on again which it generally did rather suddenly he fell off behind Otherwise he kept on pretty well except that he had a habit of now and then falling off sideways and as he generally did this on the side on which Alice was walking she soon found that it was the best plan not to walk _quite_ close to the horse Im afraid youve not had much practice in riding she ventured to say as she was helping him up from his fifth tumble The Knight looked very much surprised and a little offended at the remark What makes you say that he asked as he scrambled back into the saddle keeping hold of Alices hair with one hand to save himself from falling over on the other side Because people dont fall off quite so often when theyve had much practice Ive had plenty of practice the Knight said very gravely plenty of practice Alice could think of nothing better to say than Indeed but she said it as heartily as she could They went on a little way in silence after this the Knight with his eyes shut muttering to himself and Alice watching anxiously for the next tumble The great art of riding the Knight suddenly began in a loud voice waving his right arm as he spoke is to keep Here the sentence ended as suddenly as it had begun as the Knight fell heavily on the top of his head exactly in the path where Alice was walking She was quite frightened this time and said in an anxious tone as she picked him up I hope no bones are broken None to speak of the Knight said as if he didnt mind breaking two or three of them The great art of riding as I was saying isto keep your balance properly Like this you know He let go the bridle and stretched out both his arms to show Alice what he meant and this time he fell flat on his back right under the horses feet Plenty of practice he went on repeating all the time that Alice was getting him on his feet again Plenty of practice Its too ridiculous cried Alice losing all her patience this time You ought to have a wooden horse on wheels that you ought Does that kind go smoothly the Knight asked in a tone of great interest clasping his arms round the horses neck as he spoke just in time to save himself from tumbling off again Much more smoothly than a live horse Alice said with a little scream of laughter in spite of all she could do to prevent it Ill get one the Knight said thoughtfully to himself One or twoseveral There was a short silence after this and then the Knight went on again Im a great hand at inventing things Now I daresay you noticed that last time you picked me up that I was looking rather thoughtful You _were_ a little grave said Alice Well just then I was inventing a new way of getting over a gatewould you like to hear it Very much indeed Alice said politely Ill tell you how I came to think of it said the Knight You see I said to myself The only difficulty is with the feet the _head_ is high enough already Now first I put my head on the top of the gatethen I stand on my headthen the feet are high enough you seethen Im over you see Yes I suppose youd be over when that was done Alice said thoughtfully but dont you think it would be rather hard I havent tried it yet the Knight said gravely so I cant tell for certainbut Im afraid it _would_ be a little hard He looked so vexed at the idea that Alice changed the subject hastily What a curious helmet youve got she said cheerfully Is that your invention too The Knight looked down proudly at his helmet which hung from the saddle Yes he said but Ive invented a better one than thatlike a sugar loaf When I used to wear it if I fell off the horse it always touched the ground directly So I had a _very_ little way to fall you seeBut there _was_ the danger of falling _into_ it to be sure That happened to me onceand the worst of it was before I could get out again the other White Knight came and put it on He thought it was his own helmet The knight looked so solemn about it that Alice did not dare to laugh Im afraid you must have hurt him she said in a trembling voice being on the top of his head I had to kick him of course the Knight said very seriously And then he took the helmet off againbut it took hours and hours to get me out I was as fast asas lightning you know But thats a different kind of fastness Alice objected The Knight shook his head It was all kinds of fastness with me I can assure you he said He raised his hands in some excitement as he said this and instantly rolled out of the saddle and fell headlong into a deep ditch Alice ran to the side of the ditch to look for him She was rather startled by the fall as for some time he had kept on very well and she was afraid that he really _was_ hurt this time However though she could see nothing but the soles of his feet she was much relieved to hear that he was talking on in his usual tone All kinds of fastness he repeated but it was careless of him to put another mans helmet onwith the man in it too How _can_ you go on talking so quietly head downwards Alice asked as she dragged him out by the feet and laid him in a heap on the bank The Knight looked surprised at the question What does it matter where my body happens to be he said My mind goes on working all the same In fact the more head downwards I am the more I keep inventing new things Now the cleverest thing of the sort that I ever did he went on after a pause was inventing a new pudding during the meatcourse In time to have it cooked for the next course said Alice Well not the _next_ course the Knight said in a slow thoughtful tone no certainly not the next _course_ Then it would have to be the next day I suppose you wouldnt have two puddingcourses in one dinner Well not the _next_ day the Knight repeated as before not the next _day_ In fact he went on holding his head down and his voice getting lower and lower I dont believe that pudding ever _was_ cooked In fact I dont believe that pudding ever _will_ be cooked And yet it was a very clever pudding to invent What did you mean it to be made of Alice asked hoping to cheer him up for the poor Knight seemed quite lowspirited about it It began with blotting paper the Knight answered with a groan That wouldnt be very nice Im afraid Not very nice _alone_ he interrupted quite eagerly but youve no idea what a difference it makes mixing it with other thingssuch as gunpowder and sealingwax And here I must leave you They had just come to the end of the wood Alice could only look puzzled she was thinking of the pudding You are sad the Knight said in an anxious tone let me sing you a song to comfort you Is it very long Alice asked for she had heard a good deal of poetry that day Its long said the Knight but very _very_ beautiful Everybody that hears me sing iteither it brings the _tears_ into their eyes or else Or else what said Alice for the Knight had made a sudden pause Or else it doesnt you know The name of the song is called _Haddocks Eyes_ Oh thats the name of the song is it Alice said trying to feel interested No you dont understand the Knight said looking a little vexed Thats what the name is _called_ The name really _is_ _The Aged Aged Man_ Then I ought to have said Thats what the _song_ is called Alice corrected herself No you oughtnt thats quite another thing The _song_ is called _Ways and Means_ but thats only what its _called_ you know Well what _is_ the song then said Alice who was by this time completely bewildered I was coming to that the Knight said The song really _is_ _Asitting On A Gate_ and the tunes my own invention So saying he stopped his horse and let the reins fall on its neck then slowly beating time with one hand and with a faint smile lighting up his gentle foolish face as if he enjoyed the music of his song he began Of all the strange things that Alice saw in her journey Through The LookingGlass this was the one that she always remembered most clearly Years afterwards she could bring the whole scene back again as if it had been only yesterdaythe mild blue eyes and kindly smile of the Knightthe setting sun gleaming through his hair and shining on his armour in a blaze of light that quite dazzled herthe horse quietly moving about with the reins hanging loose on his neck cropping the grass at her feetand the black shadows of the forest behindall this she took in like a picture as with one hand shading her eyes she leant against a tree watching the strange pair and listening in a half dream to the melancholy music of the song But the tune _isnt_ his own invention she said to herself its _I give thee all I can no more_ She stood and listened very attentively but no tears came into her eyes Ill tell thee everything I can Theres little to relate I saw an aged aged man Asitting on a gate Who are you aged man I said and how is it you live And his answer trickled through my head Like water through a sieve He said I look for butterflies That sleep among the wheat I make them into muttonpies And sell them in the street I sell them unto men he said Who sail on stormy seas And thats the way I get my bread A trifle if you please But I was thinking of a plan To dye ones whiskers green And always use so large a fan That they could not be seen So having no reply to give To what the old man said I cried Come tell me how you live And thumped him on the head His accents mild took up the tale He said I go my ways And when I find a mountainrill I set it in a blaze And thence they make a stuff they call Rolands Macassar Oil Yet twopencehalfpenny is all They give me for my toil But I was thinking of a way To feed oneself on batter And so go on from day to day Getting a little fatter I shook him well from side to side Until his face was blue Come tell me how you live I cried And what it is you do He said I hunt for haddocks eyes Among the heather bright And work them into waistcoatbuttons In the silent night And these I do not sell for gold Or coin of silvery shine But for a copper halfpenny And that will purchase nine I sometimes dig for buttered rolls Or set limed twigs for crabs I sometimes search the grassy knolls For wheels of Hansomcabs And thats the way he gave a wink By which I get my wealth And very gladly will I drink Your Honours noble health I heard him then for I had just Completed my design To keep the Menai bridge from rust By boiling it in wine I thanked him much for telling me The way he got his wealth But chiefly for his wish that he Might drink my noble health And now if eer by chance I put My fingers into glue Or madly squeeze a righthand foot Into a lefthand shoe Or if I drop upon my toe A very heavy weight I weep for it reminds me so Of that old man I used to know Whose look was mild whose speech was slow Whose hair was whiter than the snow Whose face was very like a crow With eyes like cinders all aglow Who seemed distracted with his woe Who rocked his body to and fro And muttered mumblingly and low As if his mouth were full of dough Who snorted like a buffalo That summer evening long ago Asitting on a gate As the Knight sang the last words of the ballad he gathered up the reins and turned his horses head along the road by which they had come Youve only a few yards to go he said down the hill and over that little brook and then youll be a QueenBut youll stay and see me off first he added as Alice turned with an eager look in the direction to which he pointed I shant be long Youll wait and wave your handkerchief when I get to that turn in the road I think itll encourage me you see Of course Ill wait said Alice and thank you very much for coming so farand for the songI liked it very much I hope so the Knight said doubtfully but you didnt cry so much as I thought you would So they shook hands and then the Knight rode slowly away into the forest It wont take long to see him _off_ I expect Alice said to herself as she stood watching him There he goes Right on his head as usual However he gets on again pretty easilythat comes of having so many things hung round the horse So she went on talking to herself as she watched the horse walking leisurely along the road and the Knight tumbling off first on one side and then on the other After the fourth or fifth tumble he reached the turn and then she waved her handkerchief to him and waited till he was out of sight I hope it encouraged him she said as she turned to run down the hill and now for the last brook and to be a Queen How grand it sounds A very few steps brought her to the edge of the brook The Eighth Square at last she cried as she bounded across and threw herself down to rest on a lawn as soft as moss with little flowerbeds dotted about it here and there Oh how glad I am to get here And what _is_ this on my head she exclaimed in a tone of dismay as she put her hands up to something very heavy and fitted tight all round her head But how _can_ it have got there without my knowing it she said to herself as she lifted it off and set it on her lap to make out what it could possibly be It was a golden crown CHAPTER IX Queen Alice Well this _is_ grand said Alice I never expected I should be a Queen so soonand Ill tell you what it is your majesty she went on in a severe tone she was always rather fond of scolding herself itll never do for you to be lolling about on the grass like that Queens have to be dignified you know So she got up and walked aboutrather stiffly just at first as she was afraid that the crown might come off but she comforted herself with the thought that there was nobody to see her and if I really am a Queen she said as she sat down again I shall be able to manage it quite well in time Everything was happening so oddly that she didnt feel a bit surprised at finding the Red Queen and the White Queen sitting close to her one on each side she would have liked very much to ask them how they came there but she feared it would not be quite civil However there would be no harm she thought in asking if the game was over Please would you tell me she began looking timidly at the Red Queen Speak when youre spoken to The Queen sharply interrupted her But if everybody obeyed that rule said Alice who was always ready for a little argument and if you only spoke when you were spoken to and the other person always waited for _you_ to begin you see nobody would ever say anything so that Ridiculous cried the Queen Why dont you see child here she broke off with a frown and after thinking for a minute suddenly changed the subject of the conversation What do you mean by If you really are a Queen What right have you to call yourself so You cant be a Queen you know till youve passed the proper examination And the sooner we begin it the better I only said if poor Alice pleaded in a piteous tone The two Queens looked at each other and the Red Queen remarked with a little shudder She _says_ she only said if But she said a great deal more than that the White Queen moaned wringing her hands Oh ever so much more than that So you did you know the Red Queen said to Alice Always speak the truththink before you speakand write it down afterwards Im sure I didnt mean Alice was beginning but the Red Queen interrupted her impatiently Thats just what I complain of You _should_ have meant What do you suppose is the use of child without any meaning Even a joke should have some meaningand a childs more important than a joke I hope You couldnt deny that even if you tried with both hands I dont deny things with my _hands_ Alice objected Nobody said you did said the Red Queen I said you couldnt if you tried Shes in that state of mind said the White Queen that she wants to deny _something_only she doesnt know what to deny A nasty vicious temper the Red Queen remarked and then there was an uncomfortable silence for a minute or two The Red Queen broke the silence by saying to the White Queen I invite you to Alices dinnerparty this afternoon The White Queen smiled feebly and said And I invite _you_ I didnt know I was to have a party at all said Alice but if there is to be one I think _I_ ought to invite the guests We gave you the opportunity of doing it the Red Queen remarked but I daresay youve not had many lessons in manners yet Manners are not taught in lessons said Alice Lessons teach you to do sums and things of that sort And you do Addition the White Queen asked Whats one and one and one and one and one and one and one and one and one and one I dont know said Alice I lost count She cant do Addition the Red Queen interrupted Can you do Subtraction Take nine from eight Nine from eight I cant you know Alice replied very readily but She cant do Subtraction said the White Queen Can you do Division Divide a loaf by a knifewhats the answer to that I suppose Alice was beginning but the Red Queen answered for her Breadandbutter of course Try another Subtraction sum Take a bone from a dog what remains Alice considered The bone wouldnt remain of course if I took itand the dog wouldnt remain it would come to bite meand Im sure _I_ shouldnt remain Then you think nothing would remain said the Red Queen I think thats the answer Wrong as usual said the Red Queen the dogs temper would remain But I dont see how Why look here the Red Queen cried The dog would lose its temper wouldnt it Perhaps it would Alice replied cautiously Then if the dog went away its temper would remain the Queen exclaimed triumphantly Alice said as gravely as she could They might go different ways But she couldnt help thinking to herself What dreadful nonsense we _are_ talking She cant do sums a _bit_ the Queens said together with great emphasis Can _you_ do sums Alice said turning suddenly on the White Queen for she didnt like being found fault with so much The Queen gasped and shut her eyes I can do Addition if you give me timebut I cant do Subtraction under _any_ circumstances Of course you know your A B C said the Red Queen To be sure I do said Alice So do I the White Queen whispered well often say it over together dear And Ill tell you a secretI can read words of one letter Isnt _that_ grand However dont be discouraged Youll come to it in time Here the Red Queen began again Can you answer useful questions she said How is bread made I know _that_ Alice cried eagerly You take some flour Where do you pick the flower the White Queen asked In a garden or in the hedges Well it isnt _picked_ at all Alice explained its _ground_ How many acres of ground said the White Queen You mustnt leave out so many things Fan her head the Red Queen anxiously interrupted Shell be feverish after so much thinking So they set to work and fanned her with bunches of leaves till she had to beg them to leave off it blew her hair about so Shes all right again now said the Red Queen Do you know Languages Whats the French for fiddlededee Fiddlededees not English Alice replied gravely Who ever said it was said the Red Queen Alice thought she saw a way out of the difficulty this time If youll tell me what language fiddlededee is Ill tell you the French for it she exclaimed triumphantly But the Red Queen drew herself up rather stiffly and said Queens never make bargains I wish Queens never asked questions Alice thought to herself Dont let us quarrel the White Queen said in an anxious tone What is the cause of lightning The cause of lightning Alice said very decidedly for she felt quite certain about this is the thunderno no she hastily corrected herself I meant the other way Its too late to correct it said the Red Queen when youve once said a thing that fixes it and you must take the consequences Which reminds me the White Queen said looking down and nervously clasping and unclasping her hands we had _such_ a thunderstorm last TuesdayI mean one of the last set of Tuesdays you know Alice was puzzled In _our_ country she remarked theres only one day at a time The Red Queen said Thats a poor thin way of doing things Now _here_ we mostly have days and nights two or three at a time and sometimes in the winter we take as many as five nights togetherfor warmth you know Are five nights warmer than one night then Alice ventured to ask Five times as warm of course But they should be five times as _cold_ by the same rule Just so cried the Red Queen Five times as warm _and_ five times as coldjust as Im five times as rich as you are _and_ five times as clever Alice sighed and gave it up Its exactly like a riddle with no answer she thought Humpty Dumpty saw it too the White Queen went on in a low voice more as if she were talking to herself He came to the door with a corkscrew in his hand What did he want said the Red Queen He said he _would_ come in the White Queen went on because he was looking for a hippopotamus Now as it happened there wasnt such a thing in the house that morning Is there generally Alice asked in an astonished tone Well only on Thursdays said the Queen I know what he came for said Alice he wanted to punish the fish because Here the White Queen began again It was _such_ a thunderstorm you cant think She _never_ could you know said the Red Queen And part of the roof came off and ever so much thunder got inand it went rolling round the room in great lumpsand knocking over the tables and thingstill I was so frightened I couldnt remember my own name Alice thought to herself I never should _try_ to remember my name in the middle of an accident Where would be the use of it but she did not say this aloud for fear of hurting the poor Queens feeling Your Majesty must excuse her the Red Queen said to Alice taking one of the White Queens hands in her own and gently stroking it she means well but she cant help saying foolish things as a general rule The White Queen looked timidly at Alice who felt she _ought_ to say something kind but really couldnt think of anything at the moment She never was really well brought up the Red Queen went on but its amazing how goodtempered she is Pat her on the head and see how pleased shell be But this was more than Alice had courage to do A little kindnessand putting her hair in paperswould do wonders with her The White Queen gave a deep sigh and laid her head on Alices shoulder I _am_ so sleepy she moaned Shes tired poor thing said the Red Queen Smooth her hairlend her your nightcapand sing her a soothing lullaby I havent got a nightcap with me said Alice as she tried to obey the first direction and I dont know any soothing lullabies I must do it myself then said the Red Queen and she began Hushaby lady in Alices lap Till the feasts ready weve time for a nap When the feasts over well go to the ball Red Queen and White Queen and Alice and all And now you know the words she added as she put her head down on Alices other shoulder just sing it through to _me_ Im getting sleepy too In another moment both Queens were fast asleep and snoring loud What _am_ I to do exclaimed Alice looking about in great perplexity as first one round head and then the other rolled down from her shoulder and lay like a heavy lump in her lap I dont think it _ever_ happened before that any one had to take care of two Queens asleep at once No not in all the History of Englandit couldnt you know because there never was more than one Queen at a time Do wake up you heavy things she went on in an impatient tone but there was no answer but a gentle snoring The snoring got more distinct every minute and sounded more like a tune at last she could even make out the words and she listened so eagerly that when the two great heads vanished from her lap she hardly missed them She was standing before an arched doorway over which were the words QUEEN ALICE in large letters and on each side of the arch there was a bellhandle one was marked Visitors Bell and the other Servants Bell Ill wait till the songs over thought Alice and then Ill ringthe_which_ bell must I ring she went on very much puzzled by the names Im not a visitor and Im not a servant There _ought_ to be one marked Queen you know Just then the door opened a little way and a creature with a long beak put its head out for a moment and said No admittance till the week after next and shut the door again with a bang Alice knocked and rang in vain for a long time but at last a very old Frog who was sitting under a tree got up and hobbled slowly towards her he was dressed in bright yellow and had enormous boots on What is it now the Frog said in a deep hoarse whisper Alice turned round ready to find fault with anybody Wheres the servant whose business it is to answer the door she began angrily Which door said the Frog Alice almost stamped with irritation at the slow drawl in which he spoke _This_ door of course The Frog looked at the door with his large dull eyes for a minute then he went nearer and rubbed it with his thumb as if he were trying whether the paint would come off then he looked at Alice To answer the door he said Whats it been asking of He was so hoarse that Alice could scarcely hear him I dont know what you mean she said I talks English doesnt I the Frog went on Or are you deaf What did it ask you Nothing Alice said impatiently Ive been knocking at it Shouldnt do thatshouldnt do that the Frog muttered Vexes it you know Then he went up and gave the door a kick with one of his great feet You let _it_ alone he panted out as he hobbled back to his tree and itll let _you_ alone you know At this moment the door was flung open and a shrill voice was heard singing To the LookingGlass world it was Alice that said Ive a sceptre in hand Ive a crown on my head Let the LookingGlass creatures whatever they be Come and dine with the Red Queen the White Queen and me And hundreds of voices joined in the chorus Then fill up the glasses as quick as you can And sprinkle the table with buttons and bran Put cats in the coffee and mice in the tea And welcome Queen Alice with thirtytimesthree Then followed a confused noise of cheering and Alice thought to herself Thirty times three makes ninety I wonder if any ones counting In a minute there was silence again and the same shrill voice sang another verse O LookingGlass creatures quoth Alice draw near Tis an honour to see me a favour to hear Tis a privilege high to have dinner and tea Along with the Red Queen the White Queen and me Then came the chorus again Then fill up the glasses with treacle and ink Or anything else that is pleasant to drink Mix sand with the cider and wool with the wine And welcome Queen Alice with ninetytimesnine Ninety times nine Alice repeated in despair Oh thatll never be done Id better go in at once and there was a dead silence the moment she appeared Alice glanced nervously along the table as she walked up the large hall and noticed that there were about fifty guests of all kinds some were animals some birds and there were even a few flowers among them Im glad theyve come without waiting to be asked she thought I should never have known who were the right people to invite There were three chairs at the head of the table the Red and White Queens had already taken two of them but the middle one was empty Alice sat down in it rather uncomfortable in the silence and longing for some one to speak At last the Red Queen began Youve missed the soup and fish she said Put on the joint And the waiters set a leg of mutton before Alice who looked at it rather anxiously as she had never had to carve a joint before You look a little shy let me introduce you to that leg of mutton said the Red Queen AliceMutton MuttonAlice The leg of mutton got up in the dish and made a little bow to Alice and Alice returned the bow not knowing whether to be frightened or amused May I give you a slice she said taking up the knife and fork and looking from one Queen to the other Certainly not the Red Queen said very decidedly it isnt etiquette to cut any one youve been introduced to Remove the joint And the waiters carried it off and brought a large plumpudding in its place I wont be introduced to the pudding please Alice said rather hastily or we shall get no dinner at all May I give you some But the Red Queen looked sulky and growled PuddingAlice AlicePudding Remove the pudding and the waiters took it away so quickly that Alice couldnt return its bow However she didnt see why the Red Queen should be the only one to give orders so as an experiment she called out Waiter Bring back the pudding and there it was again in a moment like a conjuringtrick It was so large that she couldnt help feeling a _little_ shy with it as she had been with the mutton however she conquered her shyness by a great effort and cut a slice and handed it to the Red Queen What impertinence said the Pudding I wonder how youd like it if I were to cut a slice out of _you_ you creature It spoke in a thick suety sort of voice and Alice hadnt a word to say in reply she could only sit and look at it and gasp Make a remark said the Red Queen its ridiculous to leave all the conversation to the pudding Do you know Ive had such a quantity of poetry repeated to me today Alice began a little frightened at finding that the moment she opened her lips there was dead silence and all eyes were fixed upon her and its a very curious thing I thinkevery poem was about fishes in some way Do you know why theyre so fond of fishes all about here She spoke to the Red Queen whose answer was a little wide of the mark As to fishes she said very slowly and solemnly putting her mouth close to Alices ear her White Majesty knows a lovely riddleall in poetryall about fishes Shall she repeat it Her Red Majestys very kind to mention it the White Queen murmured into Alices other ear in a voice like the cooing of a pigeon It would be _such_ a treat May I Please do Alice said very politely The White Queen laughed with delight and stroked Alices cheek Then she began First the fish must be caught That is easy a baby I think could have caught it Next the fish must be bought That is easy a penny I think would have bought it Now cook me the fish That is easy and will not take more than a minute Let it lie in a dish That is easy because it already is in it Bring it here Let me sup It is easy to set such a dish on the table Take the dishcover up Ah that is so hard that I fear Im unable For it holds it like glue Holds the lid to the dish while it lies in the middle Which is easiest to do Undishcover the fish or dishcover the riddle Take a minute to think about it and then guess said the Red Queen Meanwhile well drink your healthQueen Alices health she screamed at the top of her voice and all the guests began drinking it directly and very queerly they managed it some of them put their glasses upon their heads like extinguishers and drank all that trickled down their facesothers upset the decanters and drank the wine as it ran off the edges of the tableand three of them who looked like kangaroos scrambled into the dish of roast mutton and began eagerly lapping up the gravy just like pigs in a trough thought Alice You ought to return thanks in a neat speech the Red Queen said frowning at Alice as she spoke We must support you you know the White Queen whispered as Alice got up to do it very obediently but a little frightened Thank you very much she whispered in reply but I can do quite well without That wouldnt be at all the thing the Red Queen said very decidedly so Alice tried to submit to it with a good grace And they _did_ push so she said afterwards when she was telling her sister the history of the feast You would have thought they wanted to squeeze me flat In fact it was rather difficult for her to keep in her place while she made her speech the two Queens pushed her so one on each side that they nearly lifted her up into the air I rise to return thanks Alice began and she really _did_ rise as she spoke several inches but she got hold of the edge of the table and managed to pull herself down again Take care of yourself screamed the White Queen seizing Alices hair with both her hands Somethings going to happen And then as Alice afterwards described it all sorts of things happened in a moment The candles all grew up to the ceiling looking something like a bed of rushes with fireworks at the top As to the bottles they each took a pair of plates which they hastily fitted on as wings and so with forks for legs went fluttering about in all directions and very like birds they look Alice thought to herself as well as she could in the dreadful confusion that was beginning At this moment she heard a hoarse laugh at her side and turned to see what was the matter with the White Queen but instead of the Queen there was the leg of mutton sitting in the chair Here I am cried a voice from the soup tureen and Alice turned again just in time to see the Queens broad goodnatured face grinning at her for a moment over the edge of the tureen before she disappeared into the soup There was not a moment to be lost Already several of the guests were lying down in the dishes and the soup ladle was walking up the table towards Alices chair and beckoning to her impatiently to get out of its way I cant stand this any longer she cried as she jumped up and seized the tablecloth with both hands one good pull and plates dishes guests and candles came crashing down together in a heap on the floor And as for _you_ she went on turning fiercely upon the Red Queen whom she considered as the cause of all the mischiefbut the Queen was no longer at her sideshe had suddenly dwindled down to the size of a little doll and was now on the table merrily running round and round after her own shawl which was trailing behind her At any other time Alice would have felt surprised at this but she was far too much excited to be surprised at anything _now_ As for _you_ she repeated catching hold of the little creature in the very act of jumping over a bottle which had just lighted upon the table Ill shake you into a kitten that I will CHAPTER X Shaking She took her off the table as she spoke and shook her backwards and forwards with all her might The Red Queen made no resistance whatever only her face grew very small and her eyes got large and green and still as Alice went on shaking her she kept on growing shorterand fatterand softerand rounderand CHAPTER XI Waking and it really _was_ a kitten after all CHAPTER XII Which Dreamed it Your majesty shouldnt purr so loud Alice said rubbing her eyes and addressing the kitten respectfully yet with some severity You woke me out of oh such a nice dream And youve been along with me Kittyall through the LookingGlass world Did you know it dear It is a very inconvenient habit of kittens Alice had once made the remark that whatever you say to them they _always_ purr If they would only purr for yes and mew for no or any rule of that sort she had said so that one could keep up a conversation But how _can_ you talk with a person if they always say the same thing On this occasion the kitten only purred and it was impossible to guess whether it meant yes or no So Alice hunted among the chessmen on the table till she had found the Red Queen then she went down on her knees on the hearthrug and put the kitten and the Queen to look at each other Now Kitty she cried clapping her hands triumphantly Confess that was what you turned into But it wouldnt look at it she said when she was explaining the thing afterwards to her sister it turned away its head and pretended not to see it but it looked a _little_ ashamed of itself so I think it _must_ have been the Red Queen Sit up a little more stiffly dear Alice cried with a merry laugh And curtsey while youre thinking what towhat to purr It saves time remember And she caught it up and gave it one little kiss just in honour of having been a Red Queen Snowdrop my pet she went on looking over her shoulder at the White Kitten which was still patiently undergoing its toilet when _will_ Dinah have finished with your White Majesty I wonder That must be the reason you were so untidy in my dreamDinah do you know that youre scrubbing a White Queen Really its most disrespectful of you And what did _Dinah_ turn to I wonder she prattled on as she settled comfortably down with one elbow in the rug and her chin in her hand to watch the kittens Tell me Dinah did you turn to Humpty Dumpty I _think_ you didhowever youd better not mention it to your friends just yet for Im not sure By the way Kitty if only youd been really with me in my dream there was one thing you _would_ have enjoyedI had such a quantity of poetry said to me all about fishes Tomorrow morning you shall have a real treat All the time youre eating your breakfast Ill repeat The Walrus and the Carpenter to you and then you can make believe its oysters dear Now Kitty lets consider who it was that dreamed it all This is a serious question my dear and you should _not_ go on licking your paw like thatas if Dinah hadnt washed you this morning You see Kitty it _must_ have been either me or the Red King He was part of my dream of coursebut then I was part of his dream too _Was_ it the Red King Kitty You were his wife my dear so you ought to knowOh Kitty _do_ help to settle it Im sure your paw can wait But the provoking kitten only began on the other paw and pretended it hadnt heard the question Which do _you_ think it was A boat beneath a sunny sky Lingering onward dreamily In an evening of July Children three that nestle near Eager eye and willing ear Pleased a simple tale to hear Long has paled that sunny sky Echoes fade and memories die Autumn frosts have slain July Still she haunts me phantomwise Alice moving under skies Never seen by waking eyes Children yet the tale to hear Eager eye and willing ear Lovingly shall nestle near In a Wonderland they lie Dreaming as the days go by Dreaming as the summers die Ever drifting down the stream

Down the RabbitHole Alice was beginning to get very tired of sitting by her sister on the bank and of having nothing to do once or twice she had peeped into the book her sister was reading but it had no pictures or conversations in it and what is the use of a book thought Alice without pictures or conversations So she was considering in her own mind as well as she could for the hot day made her feel very sleepy and stupid whether the pleasure of making a daisychain would be worth the trouble of getting up and picking the daisies when suddenly a White Rabbit with pink eyes ran close by her There was nothing so _very_ remarkable in that nor did Alice think it so _very_ much out of the way to hear the Rabbit say to itself Oh dear Oh dear I shall be late when she thought it over afterwards it occurred to her that she ought to have wondered at this but at the time it all seemed quite natural but when the Rabbit actually _took a watch out of its waistcoatpocket_ and looked at it and then hurried on Alice started to her feet for it flashed across her mind that she had never before seen a rabbit with either a waistcoatpocket or a watch to take out of it and burning with curiosity she ran across the field after it and fortunately was just in time to see it pop down a large rabbithole under the hedge In another moment down went Alice after it never once considering how in the world she was to get out again The rabbithole went straight on like a tunnel for some way and then dipped suddenly down so suddenly that Alice had not a moment to think about stopping herself before she found herself falling down a very deep well Either the well was very deep or she fell very slowly for she had plenty of time as she went down to look about her and to wonder what was going to happen next First she tried to look down and make out what she was coming to but it was too dark to see anything then she looked at the sides of the well and noticed that they were filled with cupboards and bookshelves here and there she saw maps and pictures hung upon pegs She took down a jar from one of the shelves as she passed it was labelled ORANGE MARMALADE but to her great disappointment it was empty she did not like to drop the jar for fear of killing somebody underneath so managed to put it into one of the cupboards as she fell past it Well thought Alice to herself after such a fall as this I shall think nothing of tumbling down stairs How brave theyll all think me at home Why I wouldnt say anything about it even if I fell off the top of the house Which was very likely true Down down down Would the fall _never_ come to an end I wonder how many miles Ive fallen by this time she said aloud I must be getting somewhere near the centre of the earth Let me see that would be four thousand miles down I think for you see Alice had learnt several things of this sort in her lessons in the schoolroom and though this was not a _very_ good opportunity for showing off her knowledge as there was no one to listen to her still it was good practice to say it over yes thats about the right distancebut then I wonder what Latitude or Longitude Ive got to Alice had no idea what Latitude was or Longitude either but thought they were nice grand words to say Presently she began again I wonder if I shall fall right _through_ the earth How funny itll seem to come out among the people that walk with their heads downward The Antipathies I think she was rather glad there _was_ no one listening this time as it didnt sound at all the right word but I shall have to ask them what the name of the country is you know Please Maam is this New Zealand or Australia and she tried to curtsey as she spokefancy _curtseying_ as youre falling through the air Do you think you could manage it And what an ignorant little girl shell think me for asking No itll never do to ask perhaps I shall see it written up somewhere Down down down There was nothing else to do so Alice soon began talking again Dinahll miss me very much tonight I should think Dinah was the cat I hope theyll remember her saucer of milk at teatime Dinah my dear I wish you were down here with me There are no mice in the air Im afraid but you might catch a bat and thats very like a mouse you know But do cats eat bats I wonder And here Alice began to get rather sleepy and went on saying to herself in a dreamy sort of way Do cats eat bats Do cats eat bats and sometimes Do bats eat cats for you see as she couldnt answer either question it didnt much matter which way she put it She felt that she was dozing off and had just begun to dream that she was walking hand in hand with Dinah and saying to her very earnestly Now Dinah tell me the truth did you ever eat a bat when suddenly thump thump down she came upon a heap of sticks and dry leaves and the fall was over Alice was not a bit hurt and she jumped up on to her feet in a moment she looked up but it was all dark overhead before her was another long passage and the White Rabbit was still in sight hurrying down it There was not a moment to be lost away went Alice like the wind and was just in time to hear it say as it turned a corner Oh my ears and whiskers how late its getting She was close behind it when she turned the corner but the Rabbit was no longer to be seen she found herself in a long low hall which was lit up by a row of lamps hanging from the roof There were doors all round the hall but they were all locked and when Alice had been all the way down one side and up the other trying every door she walked sadly down the middle wondering how she was ever to get out again Suddenly she came upon a little threelegged table all made of solid glass there was nothing on it except a tiny golden key and Alices first thought was that it might belong to one of the doors of the hall but alas either the locks were too large or the key was too small but at any rate it would not open any of them However on the second time round she came upon a low curtain she had not noticed before and behind it was a little door about fifteen inches high she tried the little golden key in the lock and to her great delight it fitted Alice opened the door and found that it led into a small passage not much larger than a rathole she knelt down and looked along the passage into the loveliest garden you ever saw How she longed to get out of that dark hall and wander about among those beds of bright flowers and those cool fountains but she could not even get her head through the doorway and even if my head would go through thought poor Alice it would be of very little use without my shoulders Oh how I wish I could shut up like a telescope I think I could if I only knew how to begin For you see so many outoftheway things had happened lately that Alice had begun to think that very few things indeed were really impossible There seemed to be no use in waiting by the little door so she went back to the table half hoping she might find another key on it or at any rate a book of rules for shutting people up like telescopes this time she found a little bottle on it which certainly was not here before said Alice and round the neck of the bottle was a paper label with the words DRINK ME beautifully printed on it in large letters It was all very well to say Drink me but the wise little Alice was not going to do _that_ in a hurry No Ill look first she said and see whether its marked _poison_ or not for she had read several nice little histories about children who had got burnt and eaten up by wild beasts and other unpleasant things all because they _would_ not remember the simple rules their friends had taught them such as that a redhot poker will burn you if you hold it too long and that if you cut your finger _very_ deeply with a knife it usually bleeds and she had never forgotten that if you drink much from a bottle marked poison it is almost certain to disagree with you sooner or later However this bottle was _not_ marked poison so Alice ventured to taste it and finding it very nice it had in fact a sort of mixed flavour of cherrytart custard pineapple roast turkey toffee and hot buttered toast she very soon finished it off What a curious feeling said Alice I must be shutting up like a telescope And so it was indeed she was now only ten inches high and her face brightened up at the thought that she was now the right size for going through the little door into that lovely garden First however she waited for a few minutes to see if she was going to shrink any further she felt a little nervous about this for it might end you know said Alice to herself in my going out altogether like a candle I wonder what I should be like then And she tried to fancy what the flame of a candle is like after the candle is blown out for she could not remember ever having seen such a thing After a while finding that nothing more happened she decided on going into the garden at once but alas for poor Alice when she got to the door she found she had forgotten the little golden key and when she went back to the table for it she found she could not possibly reach it she could see it quite plainly through the glass and she tried her best to climb up one of the legs of the table but it was too slippery and when she had tired herself out with trying the poor little thing sat down and cried Come theres no use in crying like that said Alice to herself rather sharply I advise you to leave off this minute She generally gave herself very good advice though she very seldom followed it and sometimes she scolded herself so severely as to bring tears into her eyes and once she remembered trying to box her own ears for having cheated herself in a game of croquet she was playing against herself for this curious child was very fond of pretending to be two people But its no use now thought poor Alice to pretend to be two people Why theres hardly enough of me left to make _one_ respectable person Soon her eye fell on a little glass box that was lying under the table she opened it and found in it a very small cake on which the words EAT ME were beautifully marked in currants Well Ill eat it said Alice and if it makes me grow larger I can reach the key and if it makes me grow smaller I can creep under the door so either way Ill get into the garden and I dont care which happens She ate a little bit and said anxiously to herself Which way Which way holding her hand on the top of her head to feel which way it was growing and she was quite surprised to find that she remained the same size to be sure this generally happens when one eats cake but Alice had got so much into the way of expecting nothing but outoftheway things to happen that it seemed quite dull and stupid for life to go on in the common way So she set to work and very soon finished off the cake CHAPTER II The Pool of Tears Curiouser and curiouser cried Alice she was so much surprised that for the moment she quite forgot how to speak good English now Im opening out like the largest telescope that ever was Goodbye feet for when she looked down at her feet they seemed to be almost out of sight they were getting so far off Oh my poor little feet I wonder who will put on your shoes and stockings for you now dears Im sure _I_ shant be able I shall be a great deal too far off to trouble myself about you you must manage the best way you canbut I must be kind to them thought Alice or perhaps they wont walk the way I want to go Let me see Ill give them a new pair of boots every Christmas And she went on planning to herself how she would manage it They must go by the carrier she thought and how funny itll seem sending presents to ones own feet And how odd the directions will look _Alices Right Foot Esq Hearthrug near the Fender_ _with Alices love_ Oh dear what nonsense Im talking Just then her head struck against the roof of the hall in fact she was now more than nine feet high and she at once took up the little golden key and hurried off to the garden door Poor Alice It was as much as she could do lying down on one side to look through into the garden with one eye but to get through was more hopeless than ever she sat down and began to cry again You ought to be ashamed of yourself said Alice a great girl like you she might well say this to go on crying in this way Stop this moment I tell you But she went on all the same shedding gallons of tears until there was a large pool all round her about four inches deep and reaching half down the hall After a time she heard a little pattering of feet in the distance and she hastily dried her eyes to see what was coming It was the White Rabbit returning splendidly dressed with a pair of white kid gloves in one hand and a large fan in the other he came trotting along in a great hurry muttering to himself as he came Oh the Duchess the Duchess Oh wont she be savage if Ive kept her waiting Alice felt so desperate that she was ready to ask help of any one so when the Rabbit came near her she began in a low timid voice If you please sir The Rabbit started violently dropped the white kid gloves and the fan and skurried away into the darkness as hard as he could go Alice took up the fan and gloves and as the hall was very hot she kept fanning herself all the time she went on talking Dear dear How queer everything is today And yesterday things went on just as usual I wonder if Ive been changed in the night Let me think was I the same when I got up this morning I almost think I can remember feeling a little different But if Im not the same the next question is Who in the world am I Ah _thats_ the great puzzle And she began thinking over all the children she knew that were of the same age as herself to see if she could have been changed for any of them Im sure Im not Ada she said for her hair goes in such long ringlets and mine doesnt go in ringlets at all and Im sure I cant be Mabel for I know all sorts of things and she oh she knows such a very little Besides _shes_ she and _Im_ I andoh dear how puzzling it all is Ill try if I know all the things I used to know Let me see four times five is twelve and four times six is thirteen and four times seven isoh dear I shall never get to twenty at that rate However the Multiplication Table doesnt signify lets try Geography London is the capital of Paris and Paris is the capital of Rome and Romeno _thats_ all wrong Im certain I must have been changed for Mabel Ill try and say _How doth the little_ and she crossed her hands on her lap as if she were saying lessons and began to repeat it but her voice sounded hoarse and strange and the words did not come the same as they used to do How doth the little crocodile Improve his shining tail And pour the waters of the Nile On every golden scale How cheerfully he seems to grin How neatly spread his claws And welcome little fishes in With gently smiling jaws Im sure those are not the right words said poor Alice and her eyes filled with tears again as she went on I must be Mabel after all and I shall have to go and live in that poky little house and have next to no toys to play with and oh ever so many lessons to learn No Ive made up my mind about it if Im Mabel Ill stay down here Itll be no use their putting their heads down and saying Come up again dear I shall only look up and say Who am I then Tell me that first and then if I like being that person Ill come up if not Ill stay down here till Im somebody elsebut oh dear cried Alice with a sudden burst of tears I do wish they _would_ put their heads down I am so _very_ tired of being all alone here As she said this she looked down at her hands and was surprised to see that she had put on one of the Rabbits little white kid gloves while she was talking How _can_ I have done that she thought I must be growing small again She got up and went to the table to measure herself by it and found that as nearly as she could guess she was now about two feet high and was going on shrinking rapidly she soon found out that the cause of this was the fan she was holding and she dropped it hastily just in time to avoid shrinking away altogether That _was_ a narrow escape said Alice a good deal frightened at the sudden change but very glad to find herself still in existence and now for the garden and she ran with all speed back to the little door but alas the little door was shut again and the little golden key was lying on the glass table as before and things are worse than ever thought the poor child for I never was so small as this before never And I declare its too bad that it is As she said these words her foot slipped and in another moment splash she was up to her chin in salt water Her first idea was that she had somehow fallen into the sea and in that case I can go back by railway she said to herself Alice had been to the seaside once in her life and had come to the general conclusion that wherever you go to on the English coast you find a number of bathing machines in the sea some children digging in the sand with wooden spades then a row of lodging houses and behind them a railway station However she soon made out that she was in the pool of tears which she had wept when she was nine feet high I wish I hadnt cried so much said Alice as she swam about trying to find her way out I shall be punished for it now I suppose by being drowned in my own tears That _will_ be a queer thing to be sure However everything is queer today Just then she heard something splashing about in the pool a little way off and she swam nearer to make out what it was at first she thought it must be a walrus or hippopotamus but then she remembered how small she was now and she soon made out that it was only a mouse that had slipped in like herself Would it be of any use now thought Alice to speak to this mouse Everything is so outoftheway down here that I should think very likely it can talk at any rate theres no harm in trying So she began O Mouse do you know the way out of this pool I am very tired of swimming about here O Mouse Alice thought this must be the right way of speaking to a mouse she had never done such a thing before but she remembered having seen in her brothers Latin Grammar A mouseof a mouseto a mousea mouseO mouse The Mouse looked at her rather inquisitively and seemed to her to wink with one of its little eyes but it said nothing Perhaps it doesnt understand English thought Alice I daresay its a French mouse come over with William the Conqueror For with all her knowledge of history Alice had no very clear notion how long ago anything had happened So she began again Où est ma chatte which was the first sentence in her French lessonbook The Mouse gave a sudden leap out of the water and seemed to quiver all over with fright Oh I beg your pardon cried Alice hastily afraid that she had hurt the poor animals feelings I quite forgot you didnt like cats Not like cats cried the Mouse in a shrill passionate voice Would _you_ like cats if you were me Well perhaps not said Alice in a soothing tone dont be angry about it And yet I wish I could show you our cat Dinah I think youd take a fancy to cats if you could only see her She is such a dear quiet thing Alice went on half to herself as she swam lazily about in the pool and she sits purring so nicely by the fire licking her paws and washing her faceand she is such a nice soft thing to nurseand shes such a capital one for catching miceoh I beg your pardon cried Alice again for this time the Mouse was bristling all over and she felt certain it must be really offended We wont talk about her any more if youd rather not We indeed cried the Mouse who was trembling down to the end of his tail As if _I_ would talk on such a subject Our family always _hated_ cats nasty low vulgar things Dont let me hear the name again I wont indeed said Alice in a great hurry to change the subject of conversation Are youare you fondofof dogs The Mouse did not answer so Alice went on eagerly There is such a nice little dog near our house I should like to show you A little brighteyed terrier you know with oh such long curly brown hair And itll fetch things when you throw them and itll sit up and beg for its dinner and all sorts of thingsI cant remember half of themand it belongs to a farmer you know and he says its so useful its worth a hundred pounds He says it kills all the rats andoh dear cried Alice in a sorrowful tone Im afraid Ive offended it again For the Mouse was swimming away from her as hard as it could go and making quite a commotion in the pool as it went So she called softly after it Mouse dear Do come back again and we wont talk about cats or dogs either if you dont like them When the Mouse heard this it turned round and swam slowly back to her its face was quite pale with passion Alice thought and it said in a low trembling voice Let us get to the shore and then Ill tell you my history and youll understand why it is I hate cats and dogs It was high time to go for the pool was getting quite crowded with the birds and animals that had fallen into it there were a Duck and a Dodo a Lory and an Eaglet and several other curious creatures Alice led the way and the whole party swam to the shore CHAPTER III A CaucusRace and a Long Tale They were indeed a queerlooking party that assembled on the bankthe birds with draggled feathers the animals with their fur clinging close to them and all dripping wet cross and uncomfortable The first question of course was how to get dry again they had a consultation about this and after a few minutes it seemed quite natural to Alice to find herself talking familiarly with them as if she had known them all her life Indeed she had quite a long argument with the Lory who at last turned sulky and would only say I am older than you and must know better and this Alice would not allow without knowing how old it was and as the Lory positively refused to tell its age there was no more to be said At last the Mouse who seemed to be a person of authority among them called out Sit down all of you and listen to me _Ill_ soon make you dry enough They all sat down at once in a large ring with the Mouse in the middle Alice kept her eyes anxiously fixed on it for she felt sure she would catch a bad cold if she did not get dry very soon Ahem said the Mouse with an important air are you all ready This is the driest thing I know Silence all round if you please William the Conqueror whose cause was favoured by the pope was soon submitted to by the English who wanted leaders and had been of late much accustomed to usurpation and conquest Edwin and Morcar the earls of Mercia and Northumbria Ugh said the Lory with a shiver I beg your pardon said the Mouse frowning but very politely Did you speak Not I said the Lory hastily I thought you did said the Mouse I proceed Edwin and Morcar the earls of Mercia and Northumbria declared for him and even Stigand the patriotic archbishop of Canterbury found it advisable Found _what_ said the Duck Found _it_ the Mouse replied rather crossly of course you know what it means I know what it means well enough when _I_ find a thing said the Duck its generally a frog or a worm The question is what did the archbishop find The Mouse did not notice this question but hurriedly went on found it advisable to go with Edgar Atheling to meet William and offer him the crown Williams conduct at first was moderate But the insolence of his Normans How are you getting on now my dear it continued turning to Alice as it spoke As wet as ever said Alice in a melancholy tone it doesnt seem to dry me at all In that case said the Dodo solemnly rising to its feet I move that the meeting adjourn for the immediate adoption of more energetic remedies Speak English said the Eaglet I dont know the meaning of half those long words and whats more I dont believe you do either And the Eaglet bent down its head to hide a smile some of the other birds tittered audibly What I was going to say said the Dodo in an offended tone was that the best thing to get us dry would be a Caucusrace What _is_ a Caucusrace said Alice not that she wanted much to know but the Dodo had paused as if it thought that _somebody_ ought to speak and no one else seemed inclined to say anything Why said the Dodo the best way to explain it is to do it And as you might like to try the thing yourself some winter day I will tell you how the Dodo managed it First it marked out a racecourse in a sort of circle the exact shape doesnt matter it said and then all the party were placed along the course here and there There was no One two three and away but they began running when they liked and left off when they liked so that it was not easy to know when the race was over However when they had been running half an hour or so and were quite dry again the Dodo suddenly called out The race is over and they all crowded round it panting and asking But who has won This question the Dodo could not answer without a great deal of thought and it sat for a long time with one finger pressed upon its forehead the position in which you usually see Shakespeare in the pictures of him while the rest waited in silence At last the Dodo said _Everybody_ has won and all must have prizes But who is to give the prizes quite a chorus of voices asked Why _she_ of course said the Dodo pointing to Alice with one finger and the whole party at once crowded round her calling out in a confused way Prizes Prizes Alice had no idea what to do and in despair she put her hand in her pocket and pulled out a box of comfits luckily the salt water had not got into it and handed them round as prizes There was exactly one apiece all round But she must have a prize herself you know said the Mouse Of course the Dodo replied very gravely What else have you got in your pocket he went on turning to Alice Only a thimble said Alice sadly Hand it over here said the Dodo Then they all crowded round her once more while the Dodo solemnly presented the thimble saying We beg your acceptance of this elegant thimble and when it had finished this short speech they all cheered Alice thought the whole thing very absurd but they all looked so grave that she did not dare to laugh and as she could not think of anything to say she simply bowed and took the thimble looking as solemn as she could The next thing was to eat the comfits this caused some noise and confusion as the large birds complained that they could not taste theirs and the small ones choked and had to be patted on the back However it was over at last and they sat down again in a ring and begged the Mouse to tell them something more You promised to tell me your history you know said Alice and why it is you hateC and D she added in a whisper half afraid that it would be offended again Mine is a long and a sad tale said the Mouse turning to Alice and sighing It _is_ a long tail certainly said Alice looking down with wonder at the Mouses tail but why do you call it sad And she kept on puzzling about it while the Mouse was speaking so that her idea of the tale was something like this Fury said to a mouse That he met in the house Let us both go to law _I_ will prosecute _you_Come Ill take no denial We must have a trial For really this morning Ive nothing to do Said the mouse to the cur Such a trial dear sir With no jury or judge would be wasting our breath Ill be judge Ill be jury Said cunning old Fury Ill try the whole cause and condemn you to death You are not attending said the Mouse to Alice severely What are you thinking of I beg your pardon said Alice very humbly you had got to the fifth bend I think I had _not_ cried the Mouse sharply and very angrily A knot said Alice always ready to make herself useful and looking anxiously about her Oh do let me help to undo it I shall do nothing of the sort said the Mouse getting up and walking away You insult me by talking such nonsense I didnt mean it pleaded poor Alice But youre so easily offended you know The Mouse only growled in reply Please come back and finish your story Alice called after it and the others all joined in chorus Yes please do but the Mouse only shook its head impatiently and walked a little quicker What a pity it wouldnt stay sighed the Lory as soon as it was quite out of sight and an old Crab took the opportunity of saying to her daughter Ah my dear Let this be a lesson to you never to lose _your_ temper Hold your tongue Ma said the young Crab a little snappishly Youre enough to try the patience of an oyster I wish I had our Dinah here I know I do said Alice aloud addressing nobody in particular Shed soon fetch it back And who is Dinah if I might venture to ask the question said the Lory Alice replied eagerly for she was always ready to talk about her pet Dinahs our cat And shes such a capital one for catching mice you cant think And oh I wish you could see her after the birds Why shell eat a little bird as soon as look at it This speech caused a remarkable sensation among the party Some of the birds hurried off at once one old Magpie began wrapping itself up very carefully remarking I really must be getting home the nightair doesnt suit my throat and a Canary called out in a trembling voice to its children Come away my dears Its high time you were all in bed On various pretexts they all moved off and Alice was soon left alone I wish I hadnt mentioned Dinah she said to herself in a melancholy tone Nobody seems to like her down here and Im sure shes the best cat in the world Oh my dear Dinah I wonder if I shall ever see you any more And here poor Alice began to cry again for she felt very lonely and lowspirited In a little while however she again heard a little pattering of footsteps in the distance and she looked up eagerly half hoping that the Mouse had changed his mind and was coming back to finish his story CHAPTER IV The Rabbit Sends in a Little Bill It was the White Rabbit trotting slowly back again and looking anxiously about as it went as if it had lost something and she heard it muttering to itself The Duchess The Duchess Oh my dear paws Oh my fur and whiskers Shell get me executed as sure as ferrets are ferrets Where _can_ I have dropped them I wonder Alice guessed in a moment that it was looking for the fan and the pair of white kid gloves and she very goodnaturedly began hunting about for them but they were nowhere to be seeneverything seemed to have changed since her swim in the pool and the great hall with the glass table and the little door had vanished completely Very soon the Rabbit noticed Alice as she went hunting about and called out to her in an angry tone Why Mary Ann what _are_ you doing out here Run home this moment and fetch me a pair of gloves and a fan Quick now And Alice was so much frightened that she ran off at once in the direction it pointed to without trying to explain the mistake it had made He took me for his housemaid she said to herself as she ran How surprised hell be when he finds out who I am But Id better take him his fan and glovesthat is if I can find them As she said this she came upon a neat little house on the door of which was a bright brass plate with the name W RABBIT engraved upon it She went in without knocking and hurried upstairs in great fear lest she should meet the real Mary Ann and be turned out of the house before she had found the fan and gloves How queer it seems Alice said to herself to be going messages for a rabbit I suppose Dinahll be sending me on messages next And she began fancying the sort of thing that would happen Miss Alice Come here directly and get ready for your walk Coming in a minute nurse But Ive got to see that the mouse doesnt get out Only I dont think Alice went on that theyd let Dinah stop in the house if it began ordering people about like that By this time she had found her way into a tidy little room with a table in the window and on it as she had hoped a fan and two or three pairs of tiny white kid gloves she took up the fan and a pair of the gloves and was just going to leave the room when her eye fell upon a little bottle that stood near the lookingglass There was no label this time with the words DRINK ME but nevertheless she uncorked it and put it to her lips I know _something_ interesting is sure to happen she said to herself whenever I eat or drink anything so Ill just see what this bottle does I do hope itll make me grow large again for really Im quite tired of being such a tiny little thing It did so indeed and much sooner than she had expected before she had drunk half the bottle she found her head pressing against the ceiling and had to stoop to save her neck from being broken She hastily put down the bottle saying to herself Thats quite enoughI hope I shant grow any moreAs it is I cant get out at the doorI do wish I hadnt drunk quite so much Alas it was too late to wish that She went on growing and growing and very soon had to kneel down on the floor in another minute there was not even room for this and she tried the effect of lying down with one elbow against the door and the other arm curled round her head Still she went on growing and as a last resource she put one arm out of the window and one foot up the chimney and said to herself Now I can do no more whatever happens What _will_ become of me Luckily for Alice the little magic bottle had now had its full effect and she grew no larger still it was very uncomfortable and as there seemed to be no sort of chance of her ever getting out of the room again no wonder she felt unhappy It was much pleasanter at home thought poor Alice when one wasnt always growing larger and smaller and being ordered about by mice and rabbits I almost wish I hadnt gone down that rabbitholeand yetand yetits rather curious you know this sort of life I do wonder what _can_ have happened to me When I used to read fairytales I fancied that kind of thing never happened and now here I am in the middle of one There ought to be a book written about me that there ought And when I grow up Ill write onebut Im grown up now she added in a sorrowful tone at least theres no room to grow up any more _here_ But then thought Alice shall I _never_ get any older than I am now Thatll be a comfort one waynever to be an old womanbut thenalways to have lessons to learn Oh I shouldnt like _that_ Oh you foolish Alice she answered herself How can you learn lessons in here Why theres hardly room for _you_ and no room at all for any lessonbooks And so she went on taking first one side and then the other and making quite a conversation of it altogether but after a few minutes she heard a voice outside and stopped to listen Mary Ann Mary Ann said the voice Fetch me my gloves this moment Then came a little pattering of feet on the stairs Alice knew it was the Rabbit coming to look for her and she trembled till she shook the house quite forgetting that she was now about a thousand times as large as the Rabbit and had no reason to be afraid of it Presently the Rabbit came up to the door and tried to open it but as the door opened inwards and Alices elbow was pressed hard against it that attempt proved a failure Alice heard it say to itself Then Ill go round and get in at the window _That_ you wont thought Alice and after waiting till she fancied she heard the Rabbit just under the window she suddenly spread out her hand and made a snatch in the air She did not get hold of anything but she heard a little shriek and a fall and a crash of broken glass from which she concluded that it was just possible it had fallen into a cucumberframe or something of the sort Next came an angry voicethe RabbitsPat Pat Where are you And then a voice she had never heard before Sure then Im here Digging for apples yer honour Digging for apples indeed said the Rabbit angrily Here Come and help me out of _this_ Sounds of more broken glass Now tell me Pat whats that in the window Sure its an arm yer honour He pronounced it arrum An arm you goose Who ever saw one that size Why it fills the whole window Sure it does yer honour but its an arm for all that Well its got no business there at any rate go and take it away There was a long silence after this and Alice could only hear whispers now and then such as Sure I dont like it yer honour at all at all Do as I tell you you coward and at last she spread out her hand again and made another snatch in the air This time there were _two_ little shrieks and more sounds of broken glass What a number of cucumberframes there must be thought Alice I wonder what theyll do next As for pulling me out of the window I only wish they _could_ Im sure _I_ dont want to stay in here any longer She waited for some time without hearing anything more at last came a rumbling of little cartwheels and the sound of a good many voices all talking together she made out the words Wheres the other ladderWhy I hadnt to bring but one Bills got the otherBill fetch it here ladHere put em up at this cornerNo tie em together firstthey dont reach half high enough yetOh theyll do well enough dont be particularHere Bill catch hold of this ropeWill the roof bearMind that loose slateOh its coming down Heads below a loud crashNow who did thatIt was Bill I fancyWhos to go down the chimneyNay _I_ shant _You_ do it_That_ I wont thenBills to go downHere Bill the master says youre to go down the chimney Oh So Bills got to come down the chimney has he said Alice to herself Shy they seem to put everything upon Bill I wouldnt be in Bills place for a good deal this fireplace is narrow to be sure but I _think_ I can kick a little She drew her foot as far down the chimney as she could and waited till she heard a little animal she couldnt guess of what sort it was scratching and scrambling about in the chimney close above her then saying to herself This is Bill she gave one sharp kick and waited to see what would happen next The first thing she heard was a general chorus of There goes Bill then the Rabbits voice alongCatch him you by the hedge then silence and then another confusion of voicesHold up his headBrandy nowDont choke himHow was it old fellow What happened to you Tell us all about it Last came a little feeble squeaking voice Thats Bill thought Alice Well I hardly knowNo more thank ye Im better nowbut Im a deal too flustered to tell youall I know is something comes at me like a Jackinthebox and up I goes like a skyrocket So you did old fellow said the others We must burn the house down said the Rabbits voice and Alice called out as loud as she could If you do Ill set Dinah at you There was a dead silence instantly and Alice thought to herself I wonder what they _will_ do next If they had any sense theyd take the roof off After a minute or two they began moving about again and Alice heard the Rabbit say A barrowful will do to begin with A barrowful of _what_ thought Alice but she had not long to doubt for the next moment a shower of little pebbles came rattling in at the window and some of them hit her in the face Ill put a stop to this she said to herself and shouted out Youd better not do that again which produced another dead silence Alice noticed with some surprise that the pebbles were all turning into little cakes as they lay on the floor and a bright idea came into her head If I eat one of these cakes she thought its sure to make _some_ change in my size and as it cant possibly make me larger it must make me smaller I suppose So she swallowed one of the cakes and was delighted to find that she began shrinking directly As soon as she was small enough to get through the door she ran out of the house and found quite a crowd of little animals and birds waiting outside The poor little Lizard Bill was in the middle being held up by two guineapigs who were giving it something out of a bottle They all made a rush at Alice the moment she appeared but she ran off as hard as she could and soon found herself safe in a thick wood The first thing Ive got to do said Alice to herself as she wandered about in the wood is to grow to my right size again and the second thing is to find my way into that lovely garden I think that will be the best plan It sounded an excellent plan no doubt and very neatly and simply arranged the only difficulty was that she had not the smallest idea how to set about it and while she was peering about anxiously among the trees a little sharp bark just over her head made her look up in a great hurry An enormous puppy was looking down at her with large round eyes and feebly stretching out one paw trying to touch her Poor little thing said Alice in a coaxing tone and she tried hard to whistle to it but she was terribly frightened all the time at the thought that it might be hungry in which case it would be very likely to eat her up in spite of all her coaxing Hardly knowing what she did she picked up a little bit of stick and held it out to the puppy whereupon the puppy jumped into the air off all its feet at once with a yelp of delight and rushed at the stick and made believe to worry it then Alice dodged behind a great thistle to keep herself from being run over and the moment she appeared on the other side the puppy made another rush at the stick and tumbled head over heels in its hurry to get hold of it then Alice thinking it was very like having a game of play with a carthorse and expecting every moment to be trampled under its feet ran round the thistle again then the puppy began a series of short charges at the stick running a very little way forwards each time and a long way back and barking hoarsely all the while till at last it sat down a good way off panting with its tongue hanging out of its mouth and its great eyes half shut This seemed to Alice a good opportunity for making her escape so she set off at once and ran till she was quite tired and out of breath and till the puppys bark sounded quite faint in the distance And yet what a dear little puppy it was said Alice as she leant against a buttercup to rest herself and fanned herself with one of the leaves I should have liked teaching it tricks very much ifif Id only been the right size to do it Oh dear Id nearly forgotten that Ive got to grow up again Let me seehow _is_ it to be managed I suppose I ought to eat or drink something or other but the great question is what The great question certainly was what Alice looked all round her at the flowers and the blades of grass but she did not see anything that looked like the right thing to eat or drink under the circumstances There was a large mushroom growing near her about the same height as herself and when she had looked under it and on both sides of it and behind it it occurred to her that she might as well look and see what was on the top of it She stretched herself up on tiptoe and peeped over the edge of the mushroom and her eyes immediately met those of a large blue caterpillar that was sitting on the top with its arms folded quietly smoking a long hookah and taking not the smallest notice of her or of anything else CHAPTER V Advice from a Caterpillar The Caterpillar and Alice looked at each other for some time in silence at last the Caterpillar took the hookah out of its mouth and addressed her in a languid sleepy voice Who are _you_ said the Caterpillar This was not an encouraging opening for a conversation Alice replied rather shyly II hardly know sir just at presentat least I know who I _was_ when I got up this morning but I think I must have been changed several times since then What do you mean by that said the Caterpillar sternly Explain yourself I cant explain _myself_ Im afraid sir said Alice because Im not myself you see I dont see said the Caterpillar Im afraid I cant put it more clearly Alice replied very politely for I cant understand it myself to begin with and being so many different sizes in a day is very confusing It isnt said the Caterpillar Well perhaps you havent found it so yet said Alice but when you have to turn into a chrysalisyou will some day you knowand then after that into a butterfly I should think youll feel it a little queer wont you Not a bit said the Caterpillar Well perhaps your feelings may be different said Alice all I know is it would feel very queer to _me_ You said the Caterpillar contemptuously Who are _you_ Which brought them back again to the beginning of the conversation Alice felt a little irritated at the Caterpillars making such _very_ short remarks and she drew herself up and said very gravely I think you ought to tell me who _you_ are first Why said the Caterpillar Here was another puzzling question and as Alice could not think of any good reason and as the Caterpillar seemed to be in a _very_ unpleasant state of mind she turned away Come back the Caterpillar called after her Ive something important to say This sounded promising certainly Alice turned and came back again Keep your temper said the Caterpillar Is that all said Alice swallowing down her anger as well as she could No said the Caterpillar Alice thought she might as well wait as she had nothing else to do and perhaps after all it might tell her something worth hearing For some minutes it puffed away without speaking but at last it unfolded its arms took the hookah out of its mouth again and said So you think youre changed do you Im afraid I am sir said Alice I cant remember things as I usedand I dont keep the same size for ten minutes together Cant remember _what_ things said the Caterpillar Well Ive tried to say How doth the little busy bee but it all came different Alice replied in a very melancholy voice Repeat _You are old Father William_ said the Caterpillar Alice folded her hands and began You are old Father William the young man said And your hair has become very white And yet you incessantly stand on your head Do you think at your age it is right In my youth Father William replied to his son I feared it might injure the brain But now that Im perfectly sure I have none Why I do it again and again You are old said the youth as I mentioned before And have grown most uncommonly fat Yet you turned a backsomersault in at the door Pray what is the reason of that In my youth said the sage as he shook his grey locks I kept all my limbs very supple By the use of this ointmentone shilling the box Allow me to sell you a couple You are old said the youth and your jaws are too weak For anything tougher than suet Yet you finished the goose with the bones and the beak Pray how did you manage to do it In my youth said his father I took to the law And argued each case with my wife And the muscular strength which it gave to my jaw Has lasted the rest of my life You are old said the youth one would hardly suppose That your eye was as steady as ever Yet you balanced an eel on the end of your nose What made you so awfully clever I have answered three questions and that is enough Said his father dont give yourself airs Do you think I can listen all day to such stuff Be off or Ill kick you down stairs That is not said right said the Caterpillar Not _quite_ right Im afraid said Alice timidly some of the words have got altered It is wrong from beginning to end said the Caterpillar decidedly and there was silence for some minutes The Caterpillar was the first to speak What size do you want to be it asked Oh Im not particular as to size Alice hastily replied only one doesnt like changing so often you know I _dont_ know said the Caterpillar Alice said nothing she had never been so much contradicted in her life before and she felt that she was losing her temper Are you content now said the Caterpillar Well I should like to be a _little_ larger sir if you wouldnt mind said Alice three inches is such a wretched height to be It is a very good height indeed said the Caterpillar angrily rearing itself upright as it spoke it was exactly three inches high But Im not used to it pleaded poor Alice in a piteous tone And she thought of herself I wish the creatures wouldnt be so easily offended Youll get used to it in time said the Caterpillar and it put the hookah into its mouth and began smoking again This time Alice waited patiently until it chose to speak again In a minute or two the Caterpillar took the hookah out of its mouth and yawned once or twice and shook itself Then it got down off the mushroom and crawled away in the grass merely remarking as it went One side will make you grow taller and the other side will make you grow shorter One side of _what_ The other side of _what_ thought Alice to herself Of the mushroom said the Caterpillar just as if she had asked it aloud and in another moment it was out of sight Alice remained looking thoughtfully at the mushroom for a minute trying to make out which were the two sides of it and as it was perfectly round she found this a very difficult question However at last she stretched her arms round it as far as they would go and broke off a bit of the edge with each hand And now which is which she said to herself and nibbled a little of the righthand bit to try the effect the next moment she felt a violent blow underneath her chin it had struck her foot She was a good deal frightened by this very sudden change but she felt that there was no time to be lost as she was shrinking rapidly so she set to work at once to eat some of the other bit Her chin was pressed so closely against her foot that there was hardly room to open her mouth but she did it at last and managed to swallow a morsel of the lefthand bit Come my heads free at last said Alice in a tone of delight which changed into alarm in another moment when she found that her shoulders were nowhere to be found all she could see when she looked down was an immense length of neck which seemed to rise like a stalk out of a sea of green leaves that lay far below her What _can_ all that green stuff be said Alice And where _have_ my shoulders got to And oh my poor hands how is it I cant see you She was moving them about as she spoke but no result seemed to follow except a little shaking among the distant green leaves As there seemed to be no chance of getting her hands up to her head she tried to get her head down to them and was delighted to find that her neck would bend about easily in any direction like a serpent She had just succeeded in curving it down into a graceful zigzag and was going to dive in among the leaves which she found to be nothing but the tops of the trees under which she had been wandering when a sharp hiss made her draw back in a hurry a large pigeon had flown into her face and was beating her violently with its wings Serpent screamed the Pigeon Im _not_ a serpent said Alice indignantly Let me alone Serpent I say again repeated the Pigeon but in a more subdued tone and added with a kind of sob Ive tried every way and nothing seems to suit them I havent the least idea what youre talking about said Alice Ive tried the roots of trees and Ive tried banks and Ive tried hedges the Pigeon went on without attending to her but those serpents Theres no pleasing them Alice was more and more puzzled but she thought there was no use in saying anything more till the Pigeon had finished As if it wasnt trouble enough hatching the eggs said the Pigeon but I must be on the lookout for serpents night and day Why I havent had a wink of sleep these three weeks Im very sorry youve been annoyed said Alice who was beginning to see its meaning And just as Id taken the highest tree in the wood continued the Pigeon raising its voice to a shriek and just as I was thinking I should be free of them at last they must needs come wriggling down from the sky Ugh Serpent But Im _not_ a serpent I tell you said Alice Im aIm a Well _What_ are you said the Pigeon I can see youre trying to invent something IIm a little girl said Alice rather doubtfully as she remembered the number of changes she had gone through that day A likely story indeed said the Pigeon in a tone of the deepest contempt Ive seen a good many little girls in my time but never _one_ with such a neck as that No no Youre a serpent and theres no use denying it I suppose youll be telling me next that you never tasted an egg I _have_ tasted eggs certainly said Alice who was a very truthful child but little girls eat eggs quite as much as serpents do you know I dont believe it said the Pigeon but if they do why then theyre a kind of serpent thats all I can say This was such a new idea to Alice that she was quite silent for a minute or two which gave the Pigeon the opportunity of adding Youre looking for eggs I know _that_ well enough and what does it matter to me whether youre a little girl or a serpent It matters a good deal to _me_ said Alice hastily but Im not looking for eggs as it happens and if I was I shouldnt want _yours_ I dont like them raw Well be off then said the Pigeon in a sulky tone as it settled down again into its nest Alice crouched down among the trees as well as she could for her neck kept getting entangled among the branches and every now and then she had to stop and untwist it After a while she remembered that she still held the pieces of mushroom in her hands and she set to work very carefully nibbling first at one and then at the other and growing sometimes taller and sometimes shorter until she had succeeded in bringing herself down to her usual height It was so long since she had been anything near the right size that it felt quite strange at first but she got used to it in a few minutes and began talking to herself as usual Come theres half my plan done now How puzzling all these changes are Im never sure what Im going to be from one minute to another However Ive got back to my right size the next thing is to get into that beautiful gardenhow _is_ that to be done I wonder As she said this she came suddenly upon an open place with a little house in it about four feet high Whoever lives there thought Alice itll never do to come upon them _this_ size why I should frighten them out of their wits So she began nibbling at the righthand bit again and did not venture to go near the house till she had brought herself down to nine inches high CHAPTER VI Pig and Pepper For a minute or two she stood looking at the house and wondering what to do next when suddenly a footman in livery came running out of the woodshe considered him to be a footman because he was in livery otherwise judging by his face only she would have called him a fishand rapped loudly at the door with his knuckles It was opened by another footman in livery with a round face and large eyes like a frog and both footmen Alice noticed had powdered hair that curled all over their heads She felt very curious to know what it was all about and crept a little way out of the wood to listen The FishFootman began by producing from under his arm a great letter nearly as large as himself and this he handed over to the other saying in a solemn tone For the Duchess An invitation from the Queen to play croquet The FrogFootman repeated in the same solemn tone only changing the order of the words a little From the Queen An invitation for the Duchess to play croquet Then they both bowed low and their curls got entangled together Alice laughed so much at this that she had to run back into the wood for fear of their hearing her and when she next peeped out the FishFootman was gone and the other was sitting on the ground near the door staring stupidly up into the sky Alice went timidly up to the door and knocked Theres no sort of use in knocking said the Footman and that for two reasons First because Im on the same side of the door as you are secondly because theyre making such a noise inside no one could possibly hear you And certainly there _was_ a most extraordinary noise going on withina constant howling and sneezing and every now and then a great crash as if a dish or kettle had been broken to pieces Please then said Alice how am I to get in There might be some sense in your knocking the Footman went on without attending to her if we had the door between us For instance if you were _inside_ you might knock and I could let you out you know He was looking up into the sky all the time he was speaking and this Alice thought decidedly uncivil But perhaps he cant help it she said to herself his eyes are so _very_ nearly at the top of his head But at any rate he might answer questionsHow am I to get in she repeated aloud I shall sit here the Footman remarked till tomorrow At this moment the door of the house opened and a large plate came skimming out straight at the Footmans head it just grazed his nose and broke to pieces against one of the trees behind him or next day maybe the Footman continued in the same tone exactly as if nothing had happened How am I to get in asked Alice again in a louder tone _Are_ you to get in at all said the Footman Thats the first question you know It was no doubt only Alice did not like to be told so Its really dreadful she muttered to herself the way all the creatures argue Its enough to drive one crazy The Footman seemed to think this a good opportunity for repeating his remark with variations I shall sit here he said on and off for days and days But what am _I_ to do said Alice Anything you like said the Footman and began whistling Oh theres no use in talking to him said Alice desperately hes perfectly idiotic And she opened the door and went in The door led right into a large kitchen which was full of smoke from one end to the other the Duchess was sitting on a threelegged stool in the middle nursing a baby the cook was leaning over the fire stirring a large cauldron which seemed to be full of soup Theres certainly too much pepper in that soup Alice said to herself as well as she could for sneezing There was certainly too much of it in the air Even the Duchess sneezed occasionally and as for the baby it was sneezing and howling alternately without a moments pause The only things in the kitchen that did not sneeze were the cook and a large cat which was sitting on the hearth and grinning from ear to ear Please would you tell me said Alice a little timidly for she was not quite sure whether it was good manners for her to speak first why your cat grins like that Its a Cheshire cat said the Duchess and thats why Pig She said the last word with such sudden violence that Alice quite jumped but she saw in another moment that it was addressed to the baby and not to her so she took courage and went on again I didnt know that Cheshire cats always grinned in fact I didnt know that cats _could_ grin They all can said the Duchess and most of em do I dont know of any that do Alice said very politely feeling quite pleased to have got into a conversation You dont know much said the Duchess and thats a fact Alice did not at all like the tone of this remark and thought it would be as well to introduce some other subject of conversation While she was trying to fix on one the cook took the cauldron of soup off the fire and at once set to work throwing everything within her reach at the Duchess and the babythe fireirons came first then followed a shower of saucepans plates and dishes The Duchess took no notice of them even when they hit her and the baby was howling so much already that it was quite impossible to say whether the blows hurt it or not Oh _please_ mind what youre doing cried Alice jumping up and down in an agony of terror Oh there goes his _precious_ nose as an unusually large saucepan flew close by it and very nearly carried it off If everybody minded their own business the Duchess said in a hoarse growl the world would go round a deal faster than it does Which would _not_ be an advantage said Alice who felt very glad to get an opportunity of showing off a little of her knowledge Just think of what work it would make with the day and night You see the earth takes twentyfour hours to turn round on its axis Talking of axes said the Duchess chop off her head Alice glanced rather anxiously at the cook to see if she meant to take the hint but the cook was busily stirring the soup and seemed not to be listening so she went on again Twentyfour hours I _think_ or is it twelve I Oh dont bother _me_ said the Duchess I never could abide figures And with that she began nursing her child again singing a sort of lullaby to it as she did so and giving it a violent shake at the end of every line Speak roughly to your little boy And beat him when he sneezes He only does it to annoy Because he knows it teases CHORUS In which the cook and the baby joined Wow wow wow While the Duchess sang the second verse of the song she kept tossing the baby violently up and down and the poor little thing howled so that Alice could hardly hear the words I speak severely to my boy I beat him when he sneezes For he can thoroughly enjoy The pepper when he pleases CHORUS Wow wow wow Here you may nurse it a bit if you like the Duchess said to Alice flinging the baby at her as she spoke I must go and get ready to play croquet with the Queen and she hurried out of the room The cook threw a fryingpan after her as she went out but it just missed her Alice caught the baby with some difficulty as it was a queershaped little creature and held out its arms and legs in all directions just like a starfish thought Alice The poor little thing was snorting like a steamengine when she caught it and kept doubling itself up and straightening itself out again so that altogether for the first minute or two it was as much as she could do to hold it As soon as she had made out the proper way of nursing it which was to twist it up into a sort of knot and then keep tight hold of its right ear and left foot so as to prevent its undoing itself she carried it out into the open air If I dont take this child away with me thought Alice theyre sure to kill it in a day or two wouldnt it be murder to leave it behind She said the last words out loud and the little thing grunted in reply it had left off sneezing by this time Dont grunt said Alice thats not at all a proper way of expressing yourself The baby grunted again and Alice looked very anxiously into its face to see what was the matter with it There could be no doubt that it had a _very_ turnup nose much more like a snout than a real nose also its eyes were getting extremely small for a baby altogether Alice did not like the look of the thing at all But perhaps it was only sobbing she thought and looked into its eyes again to see if there were any tears No there were no tears If youre going to turn into a pig my dear said Alice seriously Ill have nothing more to do with you Mind now The poor little thing sobbed again or grunted it was impossible to say which and they went on for some while in silence Alice was just beginning to think to herself Now what am I to do with this creature when I get it home when it grunted again so violently that she looked down into its face in some alarm This time there could be _no_ mistake about it it was neither more nor less than a pig and she felt that it would be quite absurd for her to carry it further So she set the little creature down and felt quite relieved to see it trot away quietly into the wood If it had grown up she said to herself it would have made a dreadfully ugly child but it makes rather a handsome pig I think And she began thinking over other children she knew who might do very well as pigs and was just saying to herself if one only knew the right way to change them when she was a little startled by seeing the Cheshire Cat sitting on a bough of a tree a few yards off The Cat only grinned when it saw Alice It looked goodnatured she thought still it had _very_ long claws and a great many teeth so she felt that it ought to be treated with respect Cheshire Puss she began rather timidly as she did not at all know whether it would like the name however it only grinned a little wider Come its pleased so far thought Alice and she went on Would you tell me please which way I ought to go from here That depends a good deal on where you want to get to said the Cat I dont much care where said Alice Then it doesnt matter which way you go said the Cat so long as I get _somewhere_ Alice added as an explanation Oh youre sure to do that said the Cat if you only walk long enough Alice felt that this could not be denied so she tried another question What sort of people live about here In _that_ direction the Cat said waving its right paw round lives a Hatter and in _that_ direction waving the other paw lives a March Hare Visit either you like theyre both mad But I dont want to go among mad people Alice remarked Oh you cant help that said the Cat were all mad here Im mad Youre mad How do you know Im mad said Alice You must be said the Cat or you wouldnt have come here Alice didnt think that proved it at all however she went on And how do you know that youre mad To begin with said the Cat a dogs not mad You grant that I suppose so said Alice Well then the Cat went on you see a dog growls when its angry and wags its tail when its pleased Now _I_ growl when Im pleased and wag my tail when Im angry Therefore Im mad _I_ call it purring not growling said Alice Call it what you like said the Cat Do you play croquet with the Queen today I should like it very much said Alice but I havent been invited yet Youll see me there said the Cat and vanished Alice was not much surprised at this she was getting so used to queer things happening While she was looking at the place where it had been it suddenly appeared again Bythebye what became of the baby said the Cat Id nearly forgotten to ask It turned into a pig Alice quietly said just as if it had come back in a natural way I thought it would said the Cat and vanished again Alice waited a little half expecting to see it again but it did not appear and after a minute or two she walked on in the direction in which the March Hare was said to live Ive seen hatters before she said to herself the March Hare will be much the most interesting and perhaps as this is May it wont be raving madat least not so mad as it was in March As she said this she looked up and there was the Cat again sitting on a branch of a tree Did you say pig or fig said the Cat I said pig replied Alice and I wish you wouldnt keep appearing and vanishing so suddenly you make one quite giddy All right said the Cat and this time it vanished quite slowly beginning with the end of the tail and ending with the grin which remained some time after the rest of it had gone Well Ive often seen a cat without a grin thought Alice but a grin without a cat Its the most curious thing I ever saw in my life She had not gone much farther before she came in sight of the house of the March Hare she thought it must be the right house because the chimneys were shaped like ears and the roof was thatched with fur It was so large a house that she did not like to go nearer till she had nibbled some more of the lefthand bit of mushroom and raised herself to about two feet high even then she walked up towards it rather timidly saying to herself Suppose it should be raving mad after all I almost wish Id gone to see the Hatter instead CHAPTER VII A Mad TeaParty There was a table set out under a tree in front of the house and the March Hare and the Hatter were having tea at it a Dormouse was sitting between them fast asleep and the other two were using it as a cushion resting their elbows on it and talking over its head Very uncomfortable for the Dormouse thought Alice only as its asleep I suppose it doesnt mind The table was a large one but the three were all crowded together at one corner of it No room No room they cried out when they saw Alice coming Theres _plenty_ of room said Alice indignantly and she sat down in a large armchair at one end of the table Have some wine the March Hare said in an encouraging tone Alice looked all round the table but there was nothing on it but tea I dont see any wine she remarked There isnt any said the March Hare Then it wasnt very civil of you to offer it said Alice angrily It wasnt very civil of you to sit down without being invited said the March Hare I didnt know it was _your_ table said Alice its laid for a great many more than three Your hair wants cutting said the Hatter He had been looking at Alice for some time with great curiosity and this was his first speech You should learn not to make personal remarks Alice said with some severity its very rude The Hatter opened his eyes very wide on hearing this but all he _said_ was Why is a raven like a writingdesk Come we shall have some fun now thought Alice Im glad theyve begun asking riddlesI believe I can guess that she added aloud Do you mean that you think you can find out the answer to it said the March Hare Exactly so said Alice Then you should say what you mean the March Hare went on I do Alice hastily replied at leastat least I mean what I saythats the same thing you know Not the same thing a bit said the Hatter You might just as well say that I see what I eat is the same thing as I eat what I see You might just as well say added the March Hare that I like what I get is the same thing as I get what I like You might just as well say added the Dormouse who seemed to be talking in his sleep that I breathe when I sleep is the same thing as I sleep when I breathe It _is_ the same thing with you said the Hatter and here the conversation dropped and the party sat silent for a minute while Alice thought over all she could remember about ravens and writingdesks which wasnt much The Hatter was the first to break the silence What day of the month is it he said turning to Alice he had taken his watch out of his pocket and was looking at it uneasily shaking it every now and then and holding it to his ear Alice considered a little and then said The fourth Two days wrong sighed the Hatter I told you butter wouldnt suit the works he added looking angrily at the March Hare It was the _best_ butter the March Hare meekly replied Yes but some crumbs must have got in as well the Hatter grumbled you shouldnt have put it in with the breadknife The March Hare took the watch and looked at it gloomily then he dipped it into his cup of tea and looked at it again but he could think of nothing better to say than his first remark It was the _best_ butter you know Alice had been looking over his shoulder with some curiosity What a funny watch she remarked It tells the day of the month and doesnt tell what oclock it is Why should it muttered the Hatter Does _your_ watch tell you what year it is Of course not Alice replied very readily but thats because it stays the same year for such a long time together Which is just the case with _mine_ said the Hatter Alice felt dreadfully puzzled The Hatters remark seemed to have no sort of meaning in it and yet it was certainly English I dont quite understand you she said as politely as she could The Dormouse is asleep again said the Hatter and he poured a little hot tea upon its nose The Dormouse shook its head impatiently and said without opening its eyes Of course of course just what I was going to remark myself Have you guessed the riddle yet the Hatter said turning to Alice again No I give it up Alice replied whats the answer I havent the slightest idea said the Hatter Nor I said the March Hare Alice sighed wearily I think you might do something better with the time she said than waste it in asking riddles that have no answers If you knew Time as well as I do said the Hatter you wouldnt talk about wasting _it_ Its _him_ I dont know what you mean said Alice Of course you dont the Hatter said tossing his head contemptuously I dare say you never even spoke to Time Perhaps not Alice cautiously replied but I know I have to beat time when I learn music Ah that accounts for it said the Hatter He wont stand beating Now if you only kept on good terms with him hed do almost anything you liked with the clock For instance suppose it were nine oclock in the morning just time to begin lessons youd only have to whisper a hint to Time and round goes the clock in a twinkling Halfpast one time for dinner I only wish it was the March Hare said to itself in a whisper That would be grand certainly said Alice thoughtfully but thenI shouldnt be hungry for it you know Not at first perhaps said the Hatter but you could keep it to halfpast one as long as you liked Is that the way _you_ manage Alice asked The Hatter shook his head mournfully Not I he replied We quarrelled last Marchjust before _he_ went mad you know pointing with his tea spoon at the March Hare it was at the great concert given by the Queen of Hearts and I had to sing Twinkle twinkle little bat How I wonder what youre at You know the song perhaps Ive heard something like it said Alice It goes on you know the Hatter continued in this way Up above the world you fly Like a teatray in the sky Twinkle twinkle Here the Dormouse shook itself and began singing in its sleep _Twinkle twinkle twinkle twinkle_ and went on so long that they had to pinch it to make it stop Well Id hardly finished the first verse said the Hatter when the Queen jumped up and bawled out Hes murdering the time Off with his head How dreadfully savage exclaimed Alice And ever since that the Hatter went on in a mournful tone he wont do a thing I ask Its always six oclock now A bright idea came into Alices head Is that the reason so many teathings are put out here she asked Yes thats it said the Hatter with a sigh its always teatime and weve no time to wash the things between whiles Then you keep moving round I suppose said Alice Exactly so said the Hatter as the things get used up But what happens when you come to the beginning again Alice ventured to ask Suppose we change the subject the March Hare interrupted yawning Im getting tired of this I vote the young lady tells us a story Im afraid I dont know one said Alice rather alarmed at the proposal Then the Dormouse shall they both cried Wake up Dormouse And they pinched it on both sides at once The Dormouse slowly opened his eyes I wasnt asleep he said in a hoarse feeble voice I heard every word you fellows were saying Tell us a story said the March Hare Yes please do pleaded Alice And be quick about it added the Hatter or youll be asleep again before its done Once upon a time there were three little sisters the Dormouse began in a great hurry and their names were Elsie Lacie and Tillie and they lived at the bottom of a well What did they live on said Alice who always took a great interest in questions of eating and drinking They lived on treacle said the Dormouse after thinking a minute or two They couldnt have done that you know Alice gently remarked theyd have been ill So they were said the Dormouse _very_ ill Alice tried to fancy to herself what such an extraordinary way of living would be like but it puzzled her too much so she went on But why did they live at the bottom of a well Take some more tea the March Hare said to Alice very earnestly Ive had nothing yet Alice replied in an offended tone so I cant take more You mean you cant take _less_ said the Hatter its very easy to take _more_ than nothing Nobody asked _your_ opinion said Alice Whos making personal remarks now the Hatter asked triumphantly Alice did not quite know what to say to this so she helped herself to some tea and breadandbutter and then turned to the Dormouse and repeated her question Why did they live at the bottom of a well The Dormouse again took a minute or two to think about it and then said It was a treaclewell Theres no such thing Alice was beginning very angrily but the Hatter and the March Hare went Sh sh and the Dormouse sulkily remarked If you cant be civil youd better finish the story for yourself No please go on Alice said very humbly I wont interrupt again I dare say there may be _one_ One indeed said the Dormouse indignantly However he consented to go on And so these three little sistersthey were learning to draw you know What did they draw said Alice quite forgetting her promise Treacle said the Dormouse without considering at all this time I want a clean cup interrupted the Hatter lets all move one place on He moved on as he spoke and the Dormouse followed him the March Hare moved into the Dormouses place and Alice rather unwillingly took the place of the March Hare The Hatter was the only one who got any advantage from the change and Alice was a good deal worse off than before as the March Hare had just upset the milkjug into his plate Alice did not wish to offend the Dormouse again so she began very cautiously But I dont understand Where did they draw the treacle from You can draw water out of a waterwell said the Hatter so I should think you could draw treacle out of a treaclewelleh stupid But they were _in_ the well Alice said to the Dormouse not choosing to notice this last remark Of course they were said the Dormouse well in This answer so confused poor Alice that she let the Dormouse go on for some time without interrupting it They were learning to draw the Dormouse went on yawning and rubbing its eyes for it was getting very sleepy and they drew all manner of thingseverything that begins with an M Why with an M said Alice Why not said the March Hare Alice was silent The Dormouse had closed its eyes by this time and was going off into a doze but on being pinched by the Hatter it woke up again with a little shriek and went on that begins with an M such as mousetraps and the moon and memory and muchnessyou know you say things are much of a muchnessdid you ever see such a thing as a drawing of a muchness Really now you ask me said Alice very much confused I dont think Then you shouldnt talk said the Hatter This piece of rudeness was more than Alice could bear she got up in great disgust and walked off the Dormouse fell asleep instantly and neither of the others took the least notice of her going though she looked back once or twice half hoping that they would call after her the last time she saw them they were trying to put the Dormouse into the teapot At any rate Ill never go _there_ again said Alice as she picked her way through the wood Its the stupidest teaparty I ever was at in all my life Just as she said this she noticed that one of the trees had a door leading right into it Thats very curious she thought But everythings curious today I think I may as well go in at once And in she went Once more she found herself in the long hall and close to the little glass table Now Ill manage better this time she said to herself and began by taking the little golden key and unlocking the door that led into the garden Then she went to work nibbling at the mushroom she had kept a piece of it in her pocket till she was about a foot high then she walked down the little passage and _then_she found herself at last in the beautiful garden among the bright flowerbeds and the cool fountains CHAPTER VIII The Queens CroquetGround A large rosetree stood near the entrance of the garden the roses growing on it were white but there were three gardeners at it busily painting them red Alice thought this a very curious thing and she went nearer to watch them and just as she came up to them she heard one of them say Look out now Five Dont go splashing paint over me like that I couldnt help it said Five in a sulky tone Seven jogged my elbow On which Seven looked up and said Thats right Five Always lay the blame on others _Youd_ better not talk said Five I heard the Queen say only yesterday you deserved to be beheaded What for said the one who had spoken first Thats none of _your_ business Two said Seven Yes it _is_ his business said Five and Ill tell himit was for bringing the cook tuliproots instead of onions Seven flung down his brush and had just begun Well of all the unjust things when his eye chanced to fall upon Alice as she stood watching them and he checked himself suddenly the others looked round also and all of them bowed low Would you tell me said Alice a little timidly why you are painting those roses Five and Seven said nothing but looked at Two Two began in a low voice Why the fact is you see Miss this here ought to have been a _red_ rosetree and we put a white one in by mistake and if the Queen was to find it out we should all have our heads cut off you know So you see Miss were doing our best afore she comes to At this moment Five who had been anxiously looking across the garden called out The Queen The Queen and the three gardeners instantly threw themselves flat upon their faces There was a sound of many footsteps and Alice looked round eager to see the Queen First came ten soldiers carrying clubs these were all shaped like the three gardeners oblong and flat with their hands and feet at the corners next the ten courtiers these were ornamented all over with diamonds and walked two and two as the soldiers did After these came the royal children there were ten of them and the little dears came jumping merrily along hand in hand in couples they were all ornamented with hearts Next came the guests mostly Kings and Queens and among them Alice recognised the White Rabbit it was talking in a hurried nervous manner smiling at everything that was said and went by without noticing her Then followed the Knave of Hearts carrying the Kings crown on a crimson velvet cushion and last of all this grand procession came THE KING AND QUEEN OF HEARTS Alice was rather doubtful whether she ought not to lie down on her face like the three gardeners but she could not remember ever having heard of such a rule at processions and besides what would be the use of a procession thought she if people had all to lie down upon their faces so that they couldnt see it So she stood still where she was and waited When the procession came opposite to Alice they all stopped and looked at her and the Queen said severely Who is this She said it to the Knave of Hearts who only bowed and smiled in reply Idiot said the Queen tossing her head impatiently and turning to Alice she went on Whats your name child My name is Alice so please your Majesty said Alice very politely but she added to herself Why theyre only a pack of cards after all I neednt be afraid of them And who are _these_ said the Queen pointing to the three gardeners who were lying round the rosetree for you see as they were lying on their faces and the pattern on their backs was the same as the rest of the pack she could not tell whether they were gardeners or soldiers or courtiers or three of her own children How should _I_ know said Alice surprised at her own courage Its no business of _mine_ The Queen turned crimson with fury and after glaring at her for a moment like a wild beast screamed Off with her head Off Nonsense said Alice very loudly and decidedly and the Queen was silent The King laid his hand upon her arm and timidly said Consider my dear she is only a child The Queen turned angrily away from him and said to the Knave Turn them over The Knave did so very carefully with one foot Get up said the Queen in a shrill loud voice and the three gardeners instantly jumped up and began bowing to the King the Queen the royal children and everybody else Leave off that screamed the Queen You make me giddy And then turning to the rosetree she went on What _have_ you been doing here May it please your Majesty said Two in a very humble tone going down on one knee as he spoke we were trying _I_ see said the Queen who had meanwhile been examining the roses Off with their heads and the procession moved on three of the soldiers remaining behind to execute the unfortunate gardeners who ran to Alice for protection You shant be beheaded said Alice and she put them into a large flowerpot that stood near The three soldiers wandered about for a minute or two looking for them and then quietly marched off after the others Are their heads off shouted the Queen Their heads are gone if it please your Majesty the soldiers shouted in reply Thats right shouted the Queen Can you play croquet The soldiers were silent and looked at Alice as the question was evidently meant for her Yes shouted Alice Come on then roared the Queen and Alice joined the procession wondering very much what would happen next Itsits a very fine day said a timid voice at her side She was walking by the White Rabbit who was peeping anxiously into her face Very said Alice wheres the Duchess Hush Hush said the Rabbit in a low hurried tone He looked anxiously over his shoulder as he spoke and then raised himself upon tiptoe put his mouth close to her ear and whispered Shes under sentence of execution What for said Alice Did you say What a pity the Rabbit asked No I didnt said Alice I dont think its at all a pity I said What for She boxed the Queens ears the Rabbit began Alice gave a little scream of laughter Oh hush the Rabbit whispered in a frightened tone The Queen will hear you You see she came rather late and the Queen said Get to your places shouted the Queen in a voice of thunder and people began running about in all directions tumbling up against each other however they got settled down in a minute or two and the game began Alice thought she had never seen such a curious croquetground in her life it was all ridges and furrows the balls were live hedgehogs the mallets live flamingoes and the soldiers had to double themselves up and to stand on their hands and feet to make the arches The chief difficulty Alice found at first was in managing her flamingo she succeeded in getting its body tucked away comfortably enough under her arm with its legs hanging down but generally just as she had got its neck nicely straightened out and was going to give the hedgehog a blow with its head it _would_ twist itself round and look up in her face with such a puzzled expression that she could not help bursting out laughing and when she had got its head down and was going to begin again it was very provoking to find that the hedgehog had unrolled itself and was in the act of crawling away besides all this there was generally a ridge or furrow in the way wherever she wanted to send the hedgehog to and as the doubledup soldiers were always getting up and walking off to other parts of the ground Alice soon came to the conclusion that it was a very difficult game indeed The players all played at once without waiting for turns quarrelling all the while and fighting for the hedgehogs and in a very short time the Queen was in a furious passion and went stamping about and shouting Off with his head or Off with her head about once in a minute Alice began to feel very uneasy to be sure she had not as yet had any dispute with the Queen but she knew that it might happen any minute and then thought she what would become of me Theyre dreadfully fond of beheading people here the great wonder is that theres any one left alive She was looking about for some way of escape and wondering whether she could get away without being seen when she noticed a curious appearance in the air it puzzled her very much at first but after watching it a minute or two she made it out to be a grin and she said to herself Its the Cheshire Cat now I shall have somebody to talk to How are you getting on said the Cat as soon as there was mouth enough for it to speak with Alice waited till the eyes appeared and then nodded Its no use speaking to it she thought till its ears have come or at least one of them In another minute the whole head appeared and then Alice put down her flamingo and began an account of the game feeling very glad she had someone to listen to her The Cat seemed to think that there was enough of it now in sight and no more of it appeared I dont think they play at all fairly Alice began in rather a complaining tone and they all quarrel so dreadfully one cant hear oneself speakand they dont seem to have any rules in particular at least if there are nobody attends to themand youve no idea how confusing it is all the things being alive for instance theres the arch Ive got to go through next walking about at the other end of the groundand I should have croqueted the Queens hedgehog just now only it ran away when it saw mine coming How do you like the Queen said the Cat in a low voice Not at all said Alice shes so extremely Just then she noticed that the Queen was close behind her listening so she went on likely to win that its hardly worth while finishing the game The Queen smiled and passed on Who _are_ you talking to said the King going up to Alice and looking at the Cats head with great curiosity Its a friend of minea Cheshire Cat said Alice allow me to introduce it I dont like the look of it at all said the King however it may kiss my hand if it likes Id rather not the Cat remarked Dont be impertinent said the King and dont look at me like that He got behind Alice as he spoke A cat may look at a king said Alice Ive read that in some book but I dont remember where Well it must be removed said the King very decidedly and he called the Queen who was passing at the moment My dear I wish you would have this cat removed The Queen had only one way of settling all difficulties great or small Off with his head she said without even looking round Ill fetch the executioner myself said the King eagerly and he hurried off Alice thought she might as well go back and see how the game was going on as she heard the Queens voice in the distance screaming with passion She had already heard her sentence three of the players to be executed for having missed their turns and she did not like the look of things at all as the game was in such confusion that she never knew whether it was her turn or not So she went in search of her hedgehog The hedgehog was engaged in a fight with another hedgehog which seemed to Alice an excellent opportunity for croqueting one of them with the other the only difficulty was that her flamingo was gone across to the other side of the garden where Alice could see it trying in a helpless sort of way to fly up into a tree By the time she had caught the flamingo and brought it back the fight was over and both the hedgehogs were out of sight but it doesnt matter much thought Alice as all the arches are gone from this side of the ground So she tucked it away under her arm that it might not escape again and went back for a little more conversation with her friend When she got back to the Cheshire Cat she was surprised to find quite a large crowd collected round it there was a dispute going on between the executioner the King and the Queen who were all talking at once while all the rest were quite silent and looked very uncomfortable The moment Alice appeared she was appealed to by all three to settle the question and they repeated their arguments to her though as they all spoke at once she found it very hard indeed to make out exactly what they said The executioners argument was that you couldnt cut off a head unless there was a body to cut it off from that he had never had to do such a thing before and he wasnt going to begin at _his_ time of life The Kings argument was that anything that had a head could be beheaded and that you werent to talk nonsense The Queens argument was that if something wasnt done about it in less than no time shed have everybody executed all round It was this last remark that had made the whole party look so grave and anxious Alice could think of nothing else to say but It belongs to the Duchess youd better ask _her_ about it Shes in prison the Queen said to the executioner fetch her here And the executioner went off like an arrow The Cats head began fading away the moment he was gone and by the time he had come back with the Duchess it had entirely disappeared so the King and the executioner ran wildly up and down looking for it while the rest of the party went back to the game CHAPTER IX The Mock Turtles Story You cant think how glad I am to see you again you dear old thing said the Duchess as she tucked her arm affectionately into Alices and they walked off together Alice was very glad to find her in such a pleasant temper and thought to herself that perhaps it was only the pepper that had made her so savage when they met in the kitchen When _Im_ a Duchess she said to herself not in a very hopeful tone though I wont have any pepper in my kitchen _at all_ Soup does very well withoutMaybe its always pepper that makes people hottempered she went on very much pleased at having found out a new kind of rule and vinegar that makes them sourand camomile that makes them bitterandand barleysugar and such things that make children sweettempered I only wish people knew _that_ then they wouldnt be so stingy about it you know She had quite forgotten the Duchess by this time and was a little startled when she heard her voice close to her ear Youre thinking about something my dear and that makes you forget to talk I cant tell you just now what the moral of that is but I shall remember it in a bit Perhaps it hasnt one Alice ventured to remark Tut tut child said the Duchess Everythings got a moral if only you can find it And she squeezed herself up closer to Alices side as she spoke Alice did not much like keeping so close to her first because the Duchess was _very_ ugly and secondly because she was exactly the right height to rest her chin upon Alices shoulder and it was an uncomfortably sharp chin However she did not like to be rude so she bore it as well as she could The games going on rather better now she said by way of keeping up the conversation a little Tis so said the Duchess and the moral of that isOh tis love tis love that makes the world go round Somebody said Alice whispered that its done by everybody minding their own business Ah well It means much the same thing said the Duchess digging her sharp little chin into Alices shoulder as she added and the moral of _that_ isTake care of the sense and the sounds will take care of themselves How fond she is of finding morals in things Alice thought to herself I dare say youre wondering why I dont put my arm round your waist the Duchess said after a pause the reason is that Im doubtful about the temper of your flamingo Shall I try the experiment He might bite Alice cautiously replied not feeling at all anxious to have the experiment tried Very true said the Duchess flamingoes and mustard both bite And the moral of that isBirds of a feather flock together Only mustard isnt a bird Alice remarked Right as usual said the Duchess what a clear way you have of putting things Its a mineral I _think_ said Alice Of course it is said the Duchess who seemed ready to agree to everything that Alice said theres a large mustardmine near here And the moral of that isThe more there is of mine the less there is of yours Oh I know exclaimed Alice who had not attended to this last remark its a vegetable It doesnt look like one but it is I quite agree with you said the Duchess and the moral of that isBe what you would seem to beor if youd like it put more simplyNever imagine yourself not to be otherwise than what it might appear to others that what you were or might have been was not otherwise than what you had been would have appeared to them to be otherwise I think I should understand that better Alice said very politely if I had it written down but I cant quite follow it as you say it Thats nothing to what I could say if I chose the Duchess replied in a pleased tone Pray dont trouble yourself to say it any longer than that said Alice Oh dont talk about trouble said the Duchess I make you a present of everything Ive said as yet A cheap sort of present thought Alice Im glad they dont give birthday presents like that But she did not venture to say it out loud Thinking again the Duchess asked with another dig of her sharp little chin Ive a right to think said Alice sharply for she was beginning to feel a little worried Just about as much right said the Duchess as pigs have to fly and the m But here to Alices great surprise the Duchesss voice died away even in the middle of her favourite word moral and the arm that was linked into hers began to tremble Alice looked up and there stood the Queen in front of them with her arms folded frowning like a thunderstorm A fine day your Majesty the Duchess began in a low weak voice Now I give you fair warning shouted the Queen stamping on the ground as she spoke either you or your head must be off and that in about half no time Take your choice The Duchess took her choice and was gone in a moment Lets go on with the game the Queen said to Alice and Alice was too much frightened to say a word but slowly followed her back to the croquetground The other guests had taken advantage of the Queens absence and were resting in the shade however the moment they saw her they hurried back to the game the Queen merely remarking that a moments delay would cost them their lives All the time they were playing the Queen never left off quarrelling with the other players and shouting Off with his head or Off with her head Those whom she sentenced were taken into custody by the soldiers who of course had to leave off being arches to do this so that by the end of half an hour or so there were no arches left and all the players except the King the Queen and Alice were in custody and under sentence of execution Then the Queen left off quite out of breath and said to Alice Have you seen the Mock Turtle yet No said Alice I dont even know what a Mock Turtle is Its the thing Mock Turtle Soup is made from said the Queen I never saw one or heard of one said Alice Come on then said the Queen and he shall tell you his history As they walked off together Alice heard the King say in a low voice to the company generally You are all pardoned Come _thats_ a good thing she said to herself for she had felt quite unhappy at the number of executions the Queen had ordered They very soon came upon a Gryphon lying fast asleep in the sun If you dont know what a Gryphon is look at the picture Up lazy thing said the Queen and take this young lady to see the Mock Turtle and to hear his history I must go back and see after some executions I have ordered and she walked off leaving Alice alone with the Gryphon Alice did not quite like the look of the creature but on the whole she thought it would be quite as safe to stay with it as to go after that savage Queen so she waited The Gryphon sat up and rubbed its eyes then it watched the Queen till she was out of sight then it chuckled What fun said the Gryphon half to itself half to Alice What _is_ the fun said Alice Why _she_ said the Gryphon Its all her fancy that they never executes nobody you know Come on Everybody says come on here thought Alice as she went slowly after it I never was so ordered about in all my life never They had not gone far before they saw the Mock Turtle in the distance sitting sad and lonely on a little ledge of rock and as they came nearer Alice could hear him sighing as if his heart would break She pitied him deeply What is his sorrow she asked the Gryphon and the Gryphon answered very nearly in the same words as before Its all his fancy that he hasnt got no sorrow you know Come on So they went up to the Mock Turtle who looked at them with large eyes full of tears but said nothing This here young lady said the Gryphon she wants for to know your history she do Ill tell it her said the Mock Turtle in a deep hollow tone sit down both of you and dont speak a word till Ive finished So they sat down and nobody spoke for some minutes Alice thought to herself I dont see how he can _ever_ finish if he doesnt begin But she waited patiently Once said the Mock Turtle at last with a deep sigh I was a real Turtle These words were followed by a very long silence broken only by an occasional exclamation of Hjckrrh from the Gryphon and the constant heavy sobbing of the Mock Turtle Alice was very nearly getting up and saying Thank you sir for your interesting story but she could not help thinking there _must_ be more to come so she sat still and said nothing When we were little the Mock Turtle went on at last more calmly though still sobbing a little now and then we went to school in the sea The master was an old Turtlewe used to call him Tortoise Why did you call him Tortoise if he wasnt one Alice asked We called him Tortoise because he taught us said the Mock Turtle angrily really you are very dull You ought to be ashamed of yourself for asking such a simple question added the Gryphon and then they both sat silent and looked at poor Alice who felt ready to sink into the earth At last the Gryphon said to the Mock Turtle Drive on old fellow Dont be all day about it and he went on in these words Yes we went to school in the sea though you maynt believe it I never said I didnt interrupted Alice You did said the Mock Turtle Hold your tongue added the Gryphon before Alice could speak again The Mock Turtle went on We had the best of educationsin fact we went to school every day _Ive_ been to a dayschool too said Alice you neednt be so proud as all that With extras asked the Mock Turtle a little anxiously Yes said Alice we learned French and music And washing said the Mock Turtle Certainly not said Alice indignantly Ah then yours wasnt a really good school said the Mock Turtle in a tone of great relief Now at _ours_ they had at the end of the bill French music _and washing_extra You couldnt have wanted it much said Alice living at the bottom of the sea I couldnt afford to learn it said the Mock Turtle with a sigh I only took the regular course What was that inquired Alice Reeling and Writhing of course to begin with the Mock Turtle replied and then the different branches of ArithmeticAmbition Distraction Uglification and Derision I never heard of Uglification Alice ventured to say What is it The Gryphon lifted up both its paws in surprise What Never heard of uglifying it exclaimed You know what to beautify is I suppose Yes said Alice doubtfully it meanstomakeanythingprettier Well then the Gryphon went on if you dont know what to uglify is you _are_ a simpleton Alice did not feel encouraged to ask any more questions about it so she turned to the Mock Turtle and said What else had you to learn Well there was Mystery the Mock Turtle replied counting off the subjects on his flappers Mystery ancient and modern with Seaography then Drawlingthe Drawlingmaster was an old congereel that used to come once a week _he_ taught us Drawling Stretching and Fainting in Coils What was _that_ like said Alice Well I cant show it you myself the Mock Turtle said Im too stiff And the Gryphon never learnt it Hadnt time said the Gryphon I went to the Classics master though He was an old crab _he_ was I never went to him the Mock Turtle said with a sigh he taught Laughing and Grief they used to say So he did so he did said the Gryphon sighing in his turn and both creatures hid their faces in their paws And how many hours a day did you do lessons said Alice in a hurry to change the subject Ten hours the first day said the Mock Turtle nine the next and so on What a curious plan exclaimed Alice Thats the reason theyre called lessons the Gryphon remarked because they lessen from day to day This was quite a new idea to Alice and she thought it over a little before she made her next remark Then the eleventh day must have been a holiday Of course it was said the Mock Turtle And how did you manage on the twelfth Alice went on eagerly Thats enough about lessons the Gryphon interrupted in a very decided tone tell her something about the games now CHAPTER X The Lobster Quadrille The Mock Turtle sighed deeply and drew the back of one flapper across his eyes He looked at Alice and tried to speak but for a minute or two sobs choked his voice Same as if he had a bone in his throat said the Gryphon and it set to work shaking him and punching him in the back At last the Mock Turtle recovered his voice and with tears running down his cheeks he went on again You may not have lived much under the sea I havent said Aliceand perhaps you were never even introduced to a lobster Alice began to say I once tasted but checked herself hastily and said No never so you can have no idea what a delightful thing a Lobster Quadrille is No indeed said Alice What sort of a dance is it Why said the Gryphon you first form into a line along the seashore Two lines cried the Mock Turtle Seals turtles salmon and so on then when youve cleared all the jellyfish out of the way _That_ generally takes some time interrupted the Gryphon you advance twice Each with a lobster as a partner cried the Gryphon Of course the Mock Turtle said advance twice set to partners change lobsters and retire in same order continued the Gryphon Then you know the Mock Turtle went on you throw the The lobsters shouted the Gryphon with a bound into the air as far out to sea as you can Swim after them screamed the Gryphon Turn a somersault in the sea cried the Mock Turtle capering wildly about Change lobsters again yelled the Gryphon at the top of its voice Back to land again and thats all the first figure said the Mock Turtle suddenly dropping his voice and the two creatures who had been jumping about like mad things all this time sat down again very sadly and quietly and looked at Alice It must be a very pretty dance said Alice timidly Would you like to see a little of it said the Mock Turtle Very much indeed said Alice Come lets try the first figure said the Mock Turtle to the Gryphon We can do without lobsters you know Which shall sing Oh _you_ sing said the Gryphon Ive forgotten the words So they began solemnly dancing round and round Alice every now and then treading on her toes when they passed too close and waving their forepaws to mark the time while the Mock Turtle sang this very slowly and sadly Will you walk a little faster said a whiting to a snail Theres a porpoise close behind us and hes treading on my tail See how eagerly the lobsters and the turtles all advance They are waiting on the shinglewill you come and join the dance Will you wont you will you wont you will you join the dance Will you wont you will you wont you wont you join the dance You can really have no notion how delightful it will be When they take us up and throw us with the lobsters out to sea But the snail replied Too far too far and gave a look askance Said he thanked the whiting kindly but he would not join the dance Would not could not would not could not would not join the dance Would not could not would not could not could not join the dance What matters it how far we go his scaly friend replied There is another shore you know upon the other side The further off from England the nearer is to France Then turn not pale beloved snail but come and join the dance Will you wont you will you wont you will you join the dance Will you wont you will you wont you wont you join the dance Thank you its a very interesting dance to watch said Alice feeling very glad that it was over at last and I do so like that curious song about the whiting Oh as to the whiting said the Mock Turtle theyyouve seen them of course Yes said Alice Ive often seen them at dinn she checked herself hastily I dont know where Dinn may be said the Mock Turtle but if youve seen them so often of course you know what theyre like I believe so Alice replied thoughtfully They have their tails in their mouthsand theyre all over crumbs Youre wrong about the crumbs said the Mock Turtle crumbs would all wash off in the sea But they _have_ their tails in their mouths and the reason is here the Mock Turtle yawned and shut his eyesTell her about the reason and all that he said to the Gryphon The reason is said the Gryphon that they _would_ go with the lobsters to the dance So they got thrown out to sea So they had to fall a long way So they got their tails fast in their mouths So they couldnt get them out again Thats all Thank you said Alice its very interesting I never knew so much about a whiting before I can tell you more than that if you like said the Gryphon Do you know why its called a whiting I never thought about it said Alice Why _It does the boots and shoes_ the Gryphon replied very solemnly Alice was thoroughly puzzled Does the boots and shoes she repeated in a wondering tone Why what are _your_ shoes done with said the Gryphon I mean what makes them so shiny Alice looked down at them and considered a little before she gave her answer Theyre done with blacking I believe Boots and shoes under the sea the Gryphon went on in a deep voice are done with a whiting Now you know And what are they made of Alice asked in a tone of great curiosity Soles and eels of course the Gryphon replied rather impatiently any shrimp could have told you that If Id been the whiting said Alice whose thoughts were still running on the song Id have said to the porpoise Keep back please we dont want _you_ with us They were obliged to have him with them the Mock Turtle said no wise fish would go anywhere without a porpoise Wouldnt it really said Alice in a tone of great surprise Of course not said the Mock Turtle why if a fish came to _me_ and told me he was going a journey I should say With what porpoise Dont you mean purpose said Alice I mean what I say the Mock Turtle replied in an offended tone And the Gryphon added Come lets hear some of _your_ adventures I could tell you my adventuresbeginning from this morning said Alice a little timidly but its no use going back to yesterday because I was a different person then Explain all that said the Mock Turtle No no The adventures first said the Gryphon in an impatient tone explanations take such a dreadful time So Alice began telling them her adventures from the time when she first saw the White Rabbit She was a little nervous about it just at first the two creatures got so close to her one on each side and opened their eyes and mouths so _very_ wide but she gained courage as she went on Her listeners were perfectly quiet till she got to the part about her repeating _You are old Father William_ to the Caterpillar and the words all coming different and then the Mock Turtle drew a long breath and said Thats very curious Its all about as curious as it can be said the Gryphon It all came different the Mock Turtle repeated thoughtfully I should like to hear her try and repeat something now Tell her to begin He looked at the Gryphon as if he thought it had some kind of authority over Alice Stand up and repeat _Tis the voice of the sluggard_ said the Gryphon How the creatures order one about and make one repeat lessons thought Alice I might as well be at school at once However she got up and began to repeat it but her head was so full of the Lobster Quadrille that she hardly knew what she was saying and the words came very queer indeed Tis the voice of the Lobster I heard him declare You have baked me too brown I must sugar my hair As a duck with its eyelids so he with his nose Trims his belt and his buttons and turns out his toes later editions continued as follows When the sands are all dry he is gay as a lark And will talk in contemptuous tones of the Shark But when the tide rises and sharks are around His voice has a timid and tremulous sound Thats different from what _I_ used to say when I was a child said the Gryphon Well I never heard it before said the Mock Turtle but it sounds uncommon nonsense Alice said nothing she had sat down with her face in her hands wondering if anything would _ever_ happen in a natural way again I should like to have it explained said the Mock Turtle She cant explain it said the Gryphon hastily Go on with the next verse But about his toes the Mock Turtle persisted How _could_ he turn them out with his nose you know Its the first position in dancing Alice said but was dreadfully puzzled by the whole thing and longed to change the subject Go on with the next verse the Gryphon repeated impatiently it begins _I passed by his garden_ Alice did not dare to disobey though she felt sure it would all come wrong and she went on in a trembling voice I passed by his garden and marked with one eye How the Owl and the Panther were sharing a pie later editions continued as follows The Panther took piecrust and gravy and meat While the Owl had the dish as its share of the treat When the pie was all finished the Owl as a boon Was kindly permitted to pocket the spoon While the Panther received knife and fork with a growl And concluded the banquet What _is_ the use of repeating all that stuff the Mock Turtle interrupted if you dont explain it as you go on Its by far the most confusing thing _I_ ever heard Yes I think youd better leave off said the Gryphon and Alice was only too glad to do so Shall we try another figure of the Lobster Quadrille the Gryphon went on Or would you like the Mock Turtle to sing you a song Oh a song please if the Mock Turtle would be so kind Alice replied so eagerly that the Gryphon said in a rather offended tone Hm No accounting for tastes Sing her _Turtle Soup_ will you old fellow The Mock Turtle sighed deeply and began in a voice sometimes choked with sobs to sing this Beautiful Soup so rich and green Waiting in a hot tureen Who for such dainties would not stoop Soup of the evening beautiful Soup Soup of the evening beautiful Soup Beauootiful Soooop Beauootiful Soooop Soooop of the eeevening Beautiful beautiful Soup Beautiful Soup Who cares for fish Game or any other dish Who would not give all else for two p ennyworth only of beautiful Soup Pennyworth only of beautiful Soup Beauootiful Soooop Beauootiful Soooop Soooop of the eeevening Beautiful beautiFUL SOUP Chorus again cried the Gryphon and the Mock Turtle had just begun to repeat it when a cry of The trials beginning was heard in the distance Come on cried the Gryphon and taking Alice by the hand it hurried off without waiting for the end of the song What trial is it Alice panted as she ran but the Gryphon only answered Come on and ran the faster while more and more faintly came carried on the breeze that followed them the melancholy words Soooop of the eeevening Beautiful beautiful Soup CHAPTER XI Who Stole the Tarts The King and Queen of Hearts were seated on their throne when they arrived with a great crowd assembled about themall sorts of little birds and beasts as well as the whole pack of cards the Knave was standing before them in chains with a soldier on each side to guard him and near the King was the White Rabbit with a trumpet in one hand and a scroll of parchment in the other In the very middle of the court was a table with a large dish of tarts upon it they looked so good that it made Alice quite hungry to look at themI wish theyd get the trial done she thought and hand round the refreshments But there seemed to be no chance of this so she began looking at everything about her to pass away the time Alice had never been in a court of justice before but she had read about them in books and she was quite pleased to find that she knew the name of nearly everything there Thats the judge she said to herself because of his great wig The judge by the way was the King and as he wore his crown over the wig look at the frontispiece if you want to see how he did it he did not look at all comfortable and it was certainly not becoming And thats the jurybox thought Alice and those twelve creatures she was obliged to say creatures you see because some of them were animals and some were birds I suppose they are the jurors She said this last word two or three times over to herself being rather proud of it for she thought and rightly too that very few little girls of her age knew the meaning of it at all However jurymen would have done just as well The twelve jurors were all writing very busily on slates What are they doing Alice whispered to the Gryphon They cant have anything to put down yet before the trials begun Theyre putting down their names the Gryphon whispered in reply for fear they should forget them before the end of the trial Stupid things Alice began in a loud indignant voice but she stopped hastily for the White Rabbit cried out Silence in the court and the King put on his spectacles and looked anxiously round to make out who was talking Alice could see as well as if she were looking over their shoulders that all the jurors were writing down stupid things on their slates and she could even make out that one of them didnt know how to spell stupid and that he had to ask his neighbour to tell him A nice muddle their slatesll be in before the trials over thought Alice One of the jurors had a pencil that squeaked This of course Alice could _not_ stand and she went round the court and got behind him and very soon found an opportunity of taking it away She did it so quickly that the poor little juror it was Bill the Lizard could not make out at all what had become of it so after hunting all about for it he was obliged to write with one finger for the rest of the day and this was of very little use as it left no mark on the slate Herald read the accusation said the King On this the White Rabbit blew three blasts on the trumpet and then unrolled the parchment scroll and read as follows The Queen of Hearts she made some tarts All on a summer day The Knave of Hearts he stole those tarts And took them quite away Consider your verdict the King said to the jury Not yet not yet the Rabbit hastily interrupted Theres a great deal to come before that Call the first witness said the King and the White Rabbit blew three blasts on the trumpet and called out First witness The first witness was the Hatter He came in with a teacup in one hand and a piece of breadandbutter in the other I beg pardon your Majesty he began for bringing these in but I hadnt quite finished my tea when I was sent for You ought to have finished said the King When did you begin The Hatter looked at the March Hare who had followed him into the court arminarm with the Dormouse Fourteenth of March I _think_ it was he said Fifteenth said the March Hare Sixteenth added the Dormouse Write that down the King said to the jury and the jury eagerly wrote down all three dates on their slates and then added them up and reduced the answer to shillings and pence Take off your hat the King said to the Hatter It isnt mine said the Hatter _Stolen_ the King exclaimed turning to the jury who instantly made a memorandum of the fact I keep them to sell the Hatter added as an explanation Ive none of my own Im a hatter Here the Queen put on her spectacles and began staring at the Hatter who turned pale and fidgeted Give your evidence said the King and dont be nervous or Ill have you executed on the spot This did not seem to encourage the witness at all he kept shifting from one foot to the other looking uneasily at the Queen and in his confusion he bit a large piece out of his teacup instead of the breadandbutter Just at this moment Alice felt a very curious sensation which puzzled her a good deal until she made out what it was she was beginning to grow larger again and she thought at first she would get up and leave the court but on second thoughts she decided to remain where she was as long as there was room for her I wish you wouldnt squeeze so said the Dormouse who was sitting next to her I can hardly breathe I cant help it said Alice very meekly Im growing Youve no right to grow _here_ said the Dormouse Dont talk nonsense said Alice more boldly you know youre growing too Yes but _I_ grow at a reasonable pace said the Dormouse not in that ridiculous fashion And he got up very sulkily and crossed over to the other side of the court All this time the Queen had never left off staring at the Hatter and just as the Dormouse crossed the court she said to one of the officers of the court Bring me the list of the singers in the last concert on which the wretched Hatter trembled so that he shook both his shoes off Give your evidence the King repeated angrily or Ill have you executed whether youre nervous or not Im a poor man your Majesty the Hatter began in a trembling voice and I hadnt begun my teanot above a week or soand what with the breadandbutter getting so thinand the twinkling of the tea The twinkling of the _what_ said the King It _began_ with the tea the Hatter replied Of course twinkling begins with a T said the King sharply Do you take me for a dunce Go on Im a poor man the Hatter went on and most things twinkled after thatonly the March Hare said I didnt the March Hare interrupted in a great hurry You did said the Hatter I deny it said the March Hare He denies it said the King leave out that part Well at any rate the Dormouse said the Hatter went on looking anxiously round to see if he would deny it too but the Dormouse denied nothing being fast asleep After that continued the Hatter I cut some more breadandbutter But what did the Dormouse say one of the jury asked That I cant remember said the Hatter You _must_ remember remarked the King or Ill have you executed The miserable Hatter dropped his teacup and breadandbutter and went down on one knee Im a poor man your Majesty he began Youre a _very_ poor _speaker_ said the King Here one of the guineapigs cheered and was immediately suppressed by the officers of the court As that is rather a hard word I will just explain to you how it was done They had a large canvas bag which tied up at the mouth with strings into this they slipped the guineapig head first and then sat upon it Im glad Ive seen that done thought Alice Ive so often read in the newspapers at the end of trials There was some attempts at applause which was immediately suppressed by the officers of the court and I never understood what it meant till now If thats all you know about it you may stand down continued the King I cant go no lower said the Hatter Im on the floor as it is Then you may _sit_ down the King replied Here the other guineapig cheered and was suppressed Come that finished the guineapigs thought Alice Now we shall get on better Id rather finish my tea said the Hatter with an anxious look at the Queen who was reading the list of singers You may go said the King and the Hatter hurriedly left the court without even waiting to put his shoes on and just take his head off outside the Queen added to one of the officers but the Hatter was out of sight before the officer could get to the door Call the next witness said the King The next witness was the Duchesss cook She carried the pepperbox in her hand and Alice guessed who it was even before she got into the court by the way the people near the door began sneezing all at once Give your evidence said the King Shant said the cook The King looked anxiously at the White Rabbit who said in a low voice Your Majesty must crossexamine _this_ witness Well if I must I must the King said with a melancholy air and after folding his arms and frowning at the cook till his eyes were nearly out of sight he said in a deep voice What are tarts made of Pepper mostly said the cook Treacle said a sleepy voice behind her Collar that Dormouse the Queen shrieked out Behead that Dormouse Turn that Dormouse out of court Suppress him Pinch him Off with his whiskers For some minutes the whole court was in confusion getting the Dormouse turned out and by the time they had settled down again the cook had disappeared Never mind said the King with an air of great relief Call the next witness And he added in an undertone to the Queen Really my dear _you_ must crossexamine the next witness It quite makes my forehead ache Alice watched the White Rabbit as he fumbled over the list feeling very curious to see what the next witness would be like for they havent got much evidence _yet_ she said to herself Imagine her surprise when the White Rabbit read out at the top of his shrill little voice the name Alice CHAPTER XII Alices Evidence Here cried Alice quite forgetting in the flurry of the moment how large she had grown in the last few minutes and she jumped up in such a hurry that she tipped over the jurybox with the edge of her skirt upsetting all the jurymen on to the heads of the crowd below and there they lay sprawling about reminding her very much of a globe of goldfish she had accidentally upset the week before Oh I _beg_ your pardon she exclaimed in a tone of great dismay and began picking them up again as quickly as she could for the accident of the goldfish kept running in her head and she had a vague sort of idea that they must be collected at once and put back into the jurybox or they would die The trial cannot proceed said the King in a very grave voice until all the jurymen are back in their proper places_all_ he repeated with great emphasis looking hard at Alice as he said so Alice looked at the jurybox and saw that in her haste she had put the Lizard in head downwards and the poor little thing was waving its tail about in a melancholy way being quite unable to move She soon got it out again and put it right not that it signifies much she said to herself I should think it would be _quite_ as much use in the trial one way up as the other As soon as the jury had a little recovered from the shock of being upset and their slates and pencils had been found and handed back to them they set to work very diligently to write out a history of the accident all except the Lizard who seemed too much overcome to do anything but sit with its mouth open gazing up into the roof of the court What do you know about this business the King said to Alice Nothing said Alice Nothing _whatever_ persisted the King Nothing whatever said Alice Thats very important the King said turning to the jury They were just beginning to write this down on their slates when the White Rabbit interrupted _Un_important your Majesty means of course he said in a very respectful tone but frowning and making faces at him as he spoke _Un_important of course I meant the King hastily said and went on to himself in an undertone importantunimportantunimportantimportant as if he were trying which word sounded best Some of the jury wrote it down important and some unimportant Alice could see this as she was near enough to look over their slates but it doesnt matter a bit she thought to herself At this moment the King who had been for some time busily writing in his notebook cackled out Silence and read out from his book Rule Fortytwo _All persons more than a mile high to leave the court_ Everybody looked at Alice _Im_ not a mile high said Alice You are said the King Nearly two miles high added the Queen Well I shant go at any rate said Alice besides thats not a regular rule you invented it just now Its the oldest rule in the book said the King Then it ought to be Number One said Alice The King turned pale and shut his notebook hastily Consider your verdict he said to the jury in a low trembling voice Theres more evidence to come yet please your Majesty said the White Rabbit jumping up in a great hurry this paper has just been picked up Whats in it said the Queen I havent opened it yet said the White Rabbit but it seems to be a letter written by the prisoner toto somebody It must have been that said the King unless it was written to nobody which isnt usual you know Who is it directed to said one of the jurymen It isnt directed at all said the White Rabbit in fact theres nothing written on the _outside_ He unfolded the paper as he spoke and added It isnt a letter after all its a set of verses Are they in the prisoners handwriting asked another of the jurymen No theyre not said the White Rabbit and thats the queerest thing about it The jury all looked puzzled He must have imitated somebody elses hand said the King The jury all brightened up again Please your Majesty said the Knave I didnt write it and they cant prove I did theres no name signed at the end If you didnt sign it said the King that only makes the matter worse You _must_ have meant some mischief or else youd have signed your name like an honest man There was a general clapping of hands at this it was the first really clever thing the King had said that day That _proves_ his guilt said the Queen It proves nothing of the sort said Alice Why you dont even know what theyre about Read them said the King The White Rabbit put on his spectacles Where shall I begin please your Majesty he asked Begin at the beginning the King said gravely and go on till you come to the end then stop These were the verses the White Rabbit read They told me you had been to her And mentioned me to him She gave me a good character But said I could not swim He sent them word I had not gone We know it to be true If she should push the matter on What would become of you I gave her one they gave him two You gave us three or more They all returned from him to you Though they were mine before If I or she should chance to be Involved in this affair He trusts to you to set them free Exactly as we were My notion was that you had been Before she had this fit An obstacle that came between Him and ourselves and it Dont let him know she liked them best For this must ever be A secret kept from all the rest Between yourself and me Thats the most important piece of evidence weve heard yet said the King rubbing his hands so now let the jury If any one of them can explain it said Alice she had grown so large in the last few minutes that she wasnt a bit afraid of interrupting him Ill give him sixpence _I_ dont believe theres an atom of meaning in it The jury all wrote down on their slates _She_ doesnt believe theres an atom of meaning in it but none of them attempted to explain the paper If theres no meaning in it said the King that saves a world of trouble you know as we neednt try to find any And yet I dont know he went on spreading out the verses on his knee and looking at them with one eye I seem to see some meaning in them after all _said I could not swim_ you cant swim can you he added turning to the Knave The Knave shook his head sadly Do I look like it he said Which he certainly did _not_ being made entirely of cardboard All right so far said the King and he went on muttering over the verses to himself _We know it to be true_ thats the jury of course_I gave her one they gave him two_ why that must be what he did with the tarts you know But it goes on _they all returned from him to you_ said Alice Why there they are said the King triumphantly pointing to the tarts on the table Nothing can be clearer than _that_ Then again_before she had this fit_ you never had fits my dear I think he said to the Queen Never said the Queen furiously throwing an inkstand at the Lizard as she spoke The unfortunate little Bill had left off writing on his slate with one finger as he found it made no mark but he now hastily began again using the ink that was trickling down his face as long as it lasted Then the words dont _fit_ you said the King looking round the court with a smile There was a dead silence Its a pun the King added in an offended tone and everybody laughed Let the jury consider their verdict the King said for about the twentieth time that day No no said the Queen Sentence firstverdict afterwards Stuff and nonsense said Alice loudly The idea of having the sentence first Hold your tongue said the Queen turning purple I wont said Alice Off with her head the Queen shouted at the top of her voice Nobody moved Who cares for you said Alice she had grown to her full size by this time Youre nothing but a pack of cards At this the whole pack rose up into the air and came flying down upon her she gave a little scream half of fright and half of anger and tried to beat them off and found herself lying on the bank with her head in the lap of her sister who was gently brushing away some dead leaves that had fluttered down from the trees upon her face Wake up Alice dear said her sister Why what a long sleep youve had Oh Ive had such a curious dream said Alice and she told her sister as well as she could remember them all these strange Adventures of hers that you have just been reading about and when she had finished her sister kissed her and said It _was_ a curious dream dear certainly but now run in to your tea its getting late So Alice got up and ran off thinking while she ran as well she might what a wonderful dream it had been But her sister sat still just as she left her leaning her head on her hand watching the setting sun and thinking of little Alice and all her wonderful Adventures till she too began dreaming after a fashion and this was her dream First she dreamed of little Alice herself and once again the tiny hands were clasped upon her knee and the bright eager eyes were looking up into hersshe could hear the very tones of her voice and see that queer little toss of her head to keep back the wandering hair that _would_ always get into her eyesand still as she listened or seemed to listen the whole place around her became alive with the strange creatures of her little sisters dream The long grass rustled at her feet as the White Rabbit hurried bythe frightened Mouse splashed his way through the neighbouring poolshe could hear the rattle of the teacups as the March Hare and his friends shared their neverending meal and the shrill voice of the Queen ordering off her unfortunate guests to executiononce more the pigbaby was sneezing on the Duchesss knee while plates and dishes crashed around itonce more the shriek of the Gryphon the squeaking of the Lizards slatepencil and the choking of the suppressed guineapigs filled the air mixed up with the distant sobs of the miserable Mock Turtle So she sat on with closed eyes and half believed herself in Wonderland though she knew she had but to open them again and all would change to dull realitythe grass would be only rustling in the wind and the pool rippling to the waving of the reedsthe rattling teacups would change to tinkling sheepbells and the Queens shrill cries to the voice of the shepherd boyand the sneeze of the baby the shriek of the Gryphon and all the other queer noises would change she knew to the confused clamour of the busy farmyardwhile the lowing of the cattle in the distance would take the place of the Mock Turtles heavy sobs Lastly she pictured to herself how this same little sister of hers would in the aftertime be herself a grown woman and how she would keep through all her riper years the simple and loving heart of her childhood and how she would gather about her other little children and make _their_ eyes bright and eager with many a strange tale perhaps even with the dream of Wonderland of long ago and how she would feel with all their simple sorrows and find a pleasure in all their simple joys remembering her own childlife and the happy summer days THE END END OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK ALICES ADVENTURES IN WONDERLAND Updated editions will replace the previous onethe old editions will

Information About Project Gutenberg electronic works Professor Michael S Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared with anyone For forty years he produced and distributed Project Gutenberg eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support Project Gutenberg eBooks are often created from several printed editions all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in the US unless a copyright notice is included Thus we do not necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition Most people start at our website which has the main PG search facility wwwgutenbergorg This website includes information about Project Gutenberg including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation how to help produce our new eBooks and how to subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks']\n"
